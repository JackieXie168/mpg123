Description:
------------
This a MPEG Audio Layer 2 Player for PSS/ESC614 Soundcards 
to run under Linux.  (eg for Orchid SoundWave 32).
The chipset is based on an Analog Devices ADSP 2115 
DSP processor with 20 MIPS.

Features: 
---------
Layer 2 is possible in realtime. The driver uses IO-Port
based data transfer. (No DMA, because of a bug
in version 1 of the Echo PSS chipset)

how to use:
-----------

Build the module:
	make

Load the module e.g: (possible irqs are: 10,11,12,5,7,9)
	insmod dsp.o irq=10

Create the device: (inoffical MAJOR!)
	mknod /dev/mp2 c 62 0

Play a Layer 2 file:
	cat file.mp2 > /dev/mp2


Known bugs:
-----------
Not all modes tested .. 
I heared artifacts playing a few special layer 2 streams.
