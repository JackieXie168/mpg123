	<h2>I want to compile with Alsa but configure fails - what do I need?</h2>
	<p>Most likely, you are missing the header files for the alsa library (libasound) or even the library itself. </p>

	<h2>No sound on my AMD64 / x86_64 machine!</h2>
	<p>See bug <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1547470&group_id=135704&atid=733194">1547470</a>. There is an issue with alsa < 1.0.13 that breaks mpg123 when compiled with 64bits (on this platform only?). So just upgrade alsa and it should be fine.</p>
