:title Quick! Spot the obvious bugs in the upcomging mpg123-1.23 before I pull the trigger!
.<p>
.Download the <a href="/test/mpg123-1.23.0-rc1.tar.bz2">mpg123-1.23 RC1 tarball</a>
.(<a href="/test/mpg123-1.23.0-rc1.tar.bz2.sig">signature</a>) now and give it a spin
.on your platform to avoid me making a fool of myself by releasing something obviously
.broken. There is so much work that went into that release, but not so much testing
.on platforms that the developer(s) do not use. So, please pull out your exotic rigs
.(that includes OS X and Windows kit, from my personal perspective;-) and check if mpg123
.builds without issues and the audio output still works.
.</p>
.<p>
.I intend to make that release rather soon, so I'm thankful for quick notes about
.success (in the history neutral sense of outcome) to the mailing list or directly
.to <a href="mailto:maintainer@mpg123.org">me</a>. You can also drop by in IRC,
.#mpg123 on freenode, and drop a line there. I may not respond, but I will pick it up
.eventually.

:title Testers welcome for upcoming mpg123 with libout123 and lots of other goodies
.<p>The next mpg123 release will be a big one, packing lots of changes.
.The most prominent ones:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Welcome <a href="/api/group__out123__api.shtml"><strong>libout123</strong></a>!
.The output part of the mpg123 program finally
.got turned into a re-usable library focused on simply getting that
.audio data out, with an <a href="/api/group__out123__api.shtml">API</a>
.resembling writing to files with some fancy properties.
.</li>
.<li>
.Along with the above, the internals regarding the <strong>buffering</strong> process and interaction
.with it got reworked a lot. Of course I mean improvements, but that also always
.can mean new bugs that testing should find before relase.
.</li>
.<li>
.The <strong>terminal control</strong> got improved a bit, not only in relation with the buffer.
.It is also active by default now if there is a terminal detected.
.</li>
.<li>
.The <strong>status line</strong> printed in verbose mode now does not spill over your
.terminal boundary (causing annoying scrolling, rather quickly since
.the line also got overly long with the buffer display).
.It received a full overhaul,
.too, packing more information more compactly and consistenly in there.
.Feedback to these changes is particulary welcome, as that marks a rather
.prominent departure from earlier times.
.As a special gimmick, the line is now used as a <strong>visual progress bar</strong>, too,
.by reversing video in part of it.
.</li>
.<li><strong>non-recursive build system</strong>; You always invoke make from the toplevel
.directory and give paths relative to that as targets. This improves
.build reliability as we have proper dependencies in one tree.</li>
.</ul>
.<p>The need for testing is obvious, especially for those changes
.relating to interactive use. I also did not look much at the generic
.control interface. People with wrappers using that, please pipe up!
.</p>
.<div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">
.Make sure you use the latest <a href="/snapshot">snapshot</a> or directly the svn trunk!
.</div>
.<p>A more complete list of changes (NEWS file):</p>
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 version 42
.<ul>
.<li>This adds mpg123_framelength() and makes mpg123_position() truly obsolete.</li>
.<li>Equalizer optional now (--disable-equalizer) to save precious memory</li>
.</ul>
.</li>
.<li>First incarnation of libout123, a basic library to get audio data written
.to audio devices (or files). This collects the output modules of mpg123
.and makes them available to the wider masses. Also, the buffer logic
.(contained in libout123) got a lot of reworking which might be noticable
.in the interaction with terminal control.
.</li>
.<li>Added mpg123 --no-infoframe.
.</li>
.<li>Detect terminal on input side and enable control keys automatically.
.There is --no-control now to disable terminal control anyway.
.</li>
.<li>Avoid spillover of status line that caused unwanted terminal scrolling.
.If the terminal width is smaller than the full status string, a cut is
.made to make it fit.
.</li>
.<li>Draw a progress bar on the terminal by inversing colors behind status
.line.
.</li>
.<li>Rework the format of the status line to be more compact and consistent.
.</li>
.<li>Clip decode tables for large amplification with fixed-point decoders.
.Without that, high-pitched distortion enters really quickly when
.trying to increase volume even if output samples would not be clipped,
.weren't it for fixed-point math.
.</li>
.<li>Warning messages also start with a line break now to better fit in with
.verbose playback.
.</li>
.<li>Reporting of clipped samples also includes a line break now.
.</li>
.<li>Default for --preload now is 0.2 instead of 1 (fill whole buffer before
.playback). The maximum is 0.5 . This is mandated by corrected buffer
.interaction in libout123.
.</li>
.<li>Improved interaction with buffer process in terminal control mode.
.Seeking is more transparent now, taking dropped samples from buffer into
.account to avoid unintended jumps. Direct seeks with number row do not
.pause playback anymore.
.</li>
.<li>Silently skip APE tags (thanks to Hans de Goede).
.</li>
.<li>Some reduction in bitrot on AIX (typos in output module, build with
.--disable-largefile --with-audio=aix, real test welcome).
.</li>
.<li>Added '[' and ']' keys to skip to previous/next directory in playlist.
.</li>
.<li>Added support for Haiku to configure script (thanks to Jerome Duval).
.</li>
.<li>Remove spurious Frankenstein warning when scanning files that have no
.gapless info (the reported value of -1152 gapless sample length should be
.a giveaway anyway).
.</li>
.<li>Fix a bug in the command line parser that was present from the beginning,
.apparently, causing certain parameters (--au, --cdr) to kill off parsing
.of following ones. Nobody complained in all these years. Astounding.
.</li>
.</ul>

:title Do you flush after draining your buffer into the sink?
.<p>
.Hacking on libout123, the second coming of mpg123's output handling code
.in form of a re-usable library, I am repeatedly annoyed by some clash of terms.
.Mind, English is not my native tongue, but I reckon that may also be the case
.for folks who are responsible for the terminology around audio devices.
.</p>
.<p>
.My point is this: <em>drain</em> and <em>flush</em> are rather close in meaning in the real
.world. As verbs, both may relate to an outflow of liquid from something.
.They can both mean to get rid of said liquid, it ending up in the … well …
.in the drain (not the <em>well</em>, where it may come from). Their meaning can be
.rather directly opposed, too. In agriculture, to flush an area is to flood
.it with water. To drain it is to remove the water, possibly attemping
.to turn swamp into farmland.
.</p>
.<p>
.Once you start visualizing audio data (which stems from a transcription of
.air pressure variations) or any kind of <em>flowing</em> data  as a stream
.(of liquid, which still would technically
.include air), you got all that rich sanitation language ready at your
.disposal. So, we got streaming, pipes, sinks, draining, flushing.
.Interestingly, I never heard the term <em>spring</em> or <em>well</em> being used, just
.the boring <em>source</em>. But that may be a glimpse of sanity as <em>source</em> is
.rather well-defined in any context, unlike, well, <em>well</em>.
.</p>
.<p>
.Regarding the dreaded <em>drain</em> vs. <em>flush</em> (which also is an adjective with
.a rather weakly related meaning, in addition to a noun and a verb), there is a
.very important difference when applied to audio APIs:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>drain: Push all pending audio data to the device, make it heard.</li>
.<li>flush: Get rid of the data, silently and quickly.</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.Well, that's why I see <em>drop</em> and <em>drain</em> in the ALSA API instead
.of <em>flush</em> and <em>drain</em>. Someone figured that out long ago.
.But in the mpg123 source, I get confused by someone (maybe even myself)
.before me having thought of <em>flushing</em> things. In the code, the word ended
.up being used in both the meaning of <em>drop</em> and of <em>drain</em>.
.A mess, of course. But even when correcting
.that, there is no escape: You can write audio data to disk, where
.it ends up in a normal file. Using the stdio API, that means that to drain
.the audio to your imagined speakers (the storage device), you have to call
.fflush(). Flush to drain, here it is again!
.</p>
.<p>
.One explanation for this confusion of sanitation-related words might be
.that programmers are not the most savvy people around bathrooms. They often talk
.of plumbing, but mostly between software layers. Software, not wetware.
.</p>
.<p>
.Another simple explanation is that the English language (including
.bastardized variants around the globe, deal with being part of a minoriry,
.dear British gentlepeople)
.sucks for handling
.streams of data or liquids, wich is a bit harder than only sucking air.
.There are words with way too many meanings (yes, like using <em>way</em> this way)
.that can lead to too many contradictions depending on context.
.This ambiguity might be nice for easily getting some methaphors churned out,
.but there is this tendency that in an explosion of meaning a hungry
.thesaurus rex may appear and violently demolish your nicely designed
.thought construct.
.</p>
.<p>
.What I actually wanted to get across: There is a word that should have been
.chosen for the audio-related use of flush as opposed to drain. While both
.<em>flush</em> and <em>drain</em> suggest that things end up in the sink
.(which leads down the drain), there is a word that makes it clear that things
.do not end up where they normally would. And also, it conveys a swiftness of
.action while emptying the erstwhile container.
.</p>
.<p>
.I hereby propose to use the term <em><strong>spill</strong></em>.
.</p>
.<p>
.It's nicely defined for
.quickly getting your liquid to a place where it usually is not retrievable
.from, and definitely not where you originally intended it to be.
.It is likely that I'll go with out123_drop() anyway, for familiarity for folks
.knowing other APIs, but it is tempting to use out123_spill() instead to
.stay in the picture of managing streams/buckets of liquids.
.I am not sure what a nice plumbing-related name would be for out123_play(),
.out123_pour() perhaps? That's got some french ring to it, but of course in
.meaning far removed from the french <em>pour</em>.
.</p>
.<p>
.Perhaps it is already a mistake trying to write down programs with clear meaning using
.words from <em>any</em> language used and abused by humans for centuries.
.</p>

:title mpg123 1.22.4, a regression fix (updated)
.<p>
.With mpg123 version 1.14.1, free format support got broken by a bugfix. Classic regression.
.This release fixes that and a regression test has been added to the repository.
.</p>
.<p>
.This regression bugs me so much that I prepared a little script to fix it
.for any affected version you may have on your system with some reason
.preventing you from simply upgrading. So, here it is:
.<a href=/download/mpg123-fix-freeformat-1.14.1-to-1.22.3.sh>mpg123-fix-freeformat-1.14.1-to-1.22.3.sh</a>.

.having folks locked in suboptimal mpg123 functionality for whole
.distribution release cycles.

.<p>This release adds a bugfix for the combination of buffered playback

:title mpg123 1.22.1 fixing stupid bugs and builds (stupid or not;-)
.<p>
.This is a heartily recommened update for anyone. The bugs are not of the
.execute-funny-code type, but still ugly.
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>
.Fix mpg123-id3dump when writing images with funny (manipulated) MIME type.
.Stupid mistake in length computation of the fallback file extension caused
.junk from memory being appended to the filename if the pointer size
.is less than 64 bit. For 64 bit pointers (or longer) it was correct by
.accident.
.</li>
.<li>
.Fix pedantic build by cleaning up out123 source, also now really showing
.the encoding list in --longhelp instead of possibly, again, writing junk
.from memory in there.
.</li>
.<li>
.Not linking libmpg123 against libltdl anymore (bug 215).
.</li>
.<li>
.Update MSVC++ ports a bit to make them work again.
.</li>
.</ul>
.<p>Also, distro maintainers ... please include the diff from 1.22.0 if it applies
.(you employ a version providing mpg123-id3dump and out123).</p>

:title mpg123 1.22.0
.<p>
.And here it is, mpg123 version 1.22.0 with these changes:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Build fix: Avoid name clash on OSX SDK with "normal" being defined in an enum already.</li>
.<li>More resilience against folks who do not check errors and rather pass NULL pointers around (see NEWS.libmpg123).</li>
.<li>Fix WAV writing to stdout on Windows (bug 214).</li>
.<li>Rework Xing/Info/Lame tag parsing, also detecting short ones without the TOC now.
.In addition, the warning about file size being off is a _lot_ more accurate now.</li>
.</ul>
.<p>Note that the new release is signed with my new PGP key with the fingerprint
.D021 FF8E CF4B E097 19D6  1A27 231C 4CBC 60D5 CAFE.</p>

.<p>Get the fresh mpg123 1.20.0:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Added NEON optimized decoder for AArch64 (ARM 64bit environment)</li>
.<ul>
.  <li>enabled for --with-cpu=neon64 (NEON only) or --with-cpu=aarch64 (runtime switch between neon and generic_fpu, like arm_fpu) configuration</li>
.  <li>compatible with aarch64-linux-gnu toolchains (from Ubuntu, debian) and Xcode 5</li>
.</ul>
.<li>Added new binary out123 only with the audio output part of mpg123.
.  This is a precursor to separating out said code into a simple audio output library. It also allows plugging in some processing in a pipe before feeding to output.</li>
.<li>Prevent opendir(NULL) for unknown module directory when listing modules.</li>

:title Flexing your ARMs with mpg123 1.19.0
.<p>This fresh release improves the situation on ARM cpus a lot. We got various changes that make the life easier, especially so for folks employing GNU/Linux on ARM. Of course, some other small fixes crept in, too.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Support float and 32/24 bit integer output also with fixed-point decoders (conversion from 16 bit precision).</li>
.<li>A-Law output encoding is actually implemented now (Michael introduced the encoding back in the old days without ever implementing the conversion table, apparently).</li>
.<li>Added --with-cpu=arm_fpu as decoder choice for runtime switch between plain fpu code and NEON.</li>
.<li>Fix ARM builds to work properly on debian systems without special CFLAGS (NEON decoder, specifically).</li>
.<li>Make scripts/benchmark-cpu.pl check the return value instead of delivering crazy timings for crashed mpg123.</li>
.<li>Trigger track initialization in mpg123_info() to avoid use of uninitialized variables (watch out for MPG123_NEED_MORE return value!).</li>
.<li>Fix integer code to 32 bit numbers where it would waste 64 bit on modern systems.</li>
.<li>Add non-executable stack marking also to ARM assembly.</li>

.<p>There is a number of little issues to resolve. Thanks to our relentless bug reporters, here is mpg123 1.18.1!
.The most embarrassing one is the Frankenstein (concatenated) stream detection, which triggered all-to-easily
.on appended meta data. The list:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Do not close buffer twice with mpg123 -R (delete outdated code in control_generic()), fixing <a href="/bugs/207">bug 207</a>.</li>
.<li>Do not mess around with first command line argument to extract program name, use a copy instead, fixing <a href="/bugs/205">bug 205</a>.</li>
.<li>Prevent premature exit on timing of failure to open a track in the playlist and the user wanting to skip over it (<a href="/bugs/206">bug 206</a>).</li>
.<li>Fixup of HTTP socket mess, also avoiding unnecessary FILE objects (<a href="/bugs/204">bug 204</a>, patch by Rajeev V. Pillai).</li>
.<li>Fix playlist behaviour on slow HTTP streams, jumping back ('d' key) from first track stays at first track (thanks to Rajeev again, sub-bug of <a href="/bugs/206">bug 206</a>).</li>
.<li>Fix Frankenstein check not to stumble over ID3v1 tags. My apologies. As a bonus, the position of the concerned code in the parser is now far more logical.</li>
.</ul>
.<p>Apart from the Frankenstein one (related to the recent parser fixes), those are not freshly
.introduced regressions but issues that managed to hide for a respectable time.

:title mpg123 1.18.0 fixing regressions from 1.14.x
.<p>This is an important release fixing some nasty regressions introduced in the 1.14 series.
.Among those is indeed a buffer overflow with strange files (although not easily exploitable apart
.from denial of service since it is decoded audio data that is written).
.Other changes make the HTTP proxy requests send correct host headers, which matters for some
.proxy servers.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 version 39</li>
.<li>Big version increase for clear distinction regarding the 1.14.x regression fixes in libmpg123.</li>
.<li>Regression fix: Ensure decoder reinitialization on combination of seek and resync (buffer overflow <a href="/bugs/201">bug 201</a>, introduced in 1.14.1).</li>
.<li>Regression fix: Make parsing really end on reaching of junk limit (introduced in 1.14.4).</li>
.<li>Add check for bad bit allocation value in layer I decoder (removes audible glitch in <a href="/bugs/201">bug 201</a> test file).</li>
.<li>Avoid wrong error message about Frankenstein streams when gapless decoding disabled.</li>
.<li>Be verbose about big header changes (Frankenstein streams). Note that changes in samples per frame will confuse the seeking code, but decoding can get through.</li>
.<li>Actually use the full routine to close tracks. Avoids socket leak when playing multiple HTTP streams from a playlist (<a href="/bugs/203">bug 203</a>).</li>
.<li>Send correct host header when connecting through HTTP proxy (<a href="/bugs/202">bug 202</a>, figured out by Rajeev V. Pillai).</li>
.<li>The console application now informs about changed major stream properties (prints out another header line).</li>

:title mpg123 1.16.0
.<p>We're back! With significant performance enhancements all across the board, mpg123 is up there on the peak of MPEG audio decoding efficiency again!
.Though, we have to admit, this is a race with outcome depending on your setup. The contender ffmp3float as used from MPlayer (for some reason, usage from ffmpeg command-line tool is slower), can be faster or slower, generally not far from mpg123. On my old Core2Duo P8800, ffmp3float wins, on more modern Core i7 machines, mpg123 wins.
.On an vintage Athlon 64, ffmp3float wins. On K10 (Athlon II), mpg123 wins. On older machines (K7, K6), we need some repeated tests, but it looked good already with old mpg123.</p>
.<p>So, here is the full goodness, if you still want to read up on this before getting the current sources from the <a href="/download.shtml">download</a> section.</p>

.</li>
.<li>added configs for vintage 3DNow(ext) CPUs (AMD K6) utilizing assembly DCT36</li>
.<li>added configs for vintage SSE CPUs (Pentium M), utilizing C DCT36</li>
.<li>added FORMAT command to generic control</li>
.<li>added support for ID3v2 APIC frames</li>

.  (including writing of album art from APIC to files)</li>
.<li>added mpg123-strip as official companion to strip dirt out of MPEG streams
.  (including meta data)</li>
.<li>not deleting ID3 data right after printing in generic control</li>
.<li>module loader a bit more flexible with relative MPG123_MODDIR</li>
.<li>Fix chopped-off playback with pulseaudio output: draining the output now on closing.</li>
.<li>SDL output fixup, a) not chopping off end and b) non-fatal underrun</li>
.<li>Fix obvious errors in win32 output ... does it now play the end of tracks? Need someone to test this.</li>

:title mpg123 1.15.4
.<p>May I present the latest and last mpg123 release of the 1.15 series: It fixes some illustrous bugs, upgrade highly recommened (as always;-). Here they are:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Writing CDDA data via --cdr works again; had also been broken by attempts to catch failing writes because of full disk.</li>
.<li>Also, the return values of WAV/CDR writing routines now properly indicate error to avoid stupid endless loop of "smart" audio writing code that wants to handle interruptions. Really, --cdr could just go and nobody would miss it ...</li>
.<li>Fix stupid bug in mpg123_chomp_string() (introduced in 1.15.1), empty lines were badly treated. Only usage in mpg123 is for parsing HTTP redirect headers; malicious HTTP servers might exploit that (possibility to zero bytes in memory).</li>
.<li>some cleanup for nagging mode</li>
.<li>more resync strictness to really catch (all) cases with changing decoder structure; in practice badly needed when disabling seekbuffer (so it's your fault, somehow ...) for non-seekable streams, otherwise not really an issue because of readahead checking<br />
.<strong>I repeat:</strong> This fixes possibly fatal behaviour in the parser when readahead checking is explicitly disabled (p.ex. via mpg123 --no-seekbuffer on http streams). By default, readahead checking is <strong>always</strong> active!</li>
.<li>build system fixed for automake 1.13 (thanks to Nix)</li>
.</ul>
.<p>Reviewing the recent bugfix releases, there is a lesson to learn about not touching things unless it is really necessary and clearly beneficial. Is the fallout from trying to make WAV writing safer over yet?</p>
.<p>Apart from that, stay tuned for the upcoming 1.16.0 release with improved decoding performance! Oh, and, yes ... in the meantime, get your 1.15.4 from the <a href=/download.shtml>download</a> area.

:title Compliant again
.<p>
.A note about the MPEG compliance test on the mpg123 front page:
.This is automatically run on mpg123 trunk, the development version. In that function, the
.compliance test reported a failure in some layer I and II test bitstreams for some time recently.
.That concerned a too strict stream parsing that has been added to the development version and
.has just been corrected. So, now, fetching mpg123 directly from svn or the regular
.<a href="/snapshot">snapshot</a> gives you the best mpg123, yet, again.
.</p>
.<p>
.And indeed, featuring Taihei's improved Huffman decoding, the current development version should
.give every other decoder out there a mark to beat regarding efficiency!

:title Announcing mpg123 1.15.3
.<p>Main feature of this release is hopefully the final go at satisfying all needs concerning WAV writing to standard output. To quote the NEWS:</p>
.<p style="margin-left:2em;">
.Fix WAV writing. AGAIN. People love to decode WAV to stdout in various ways that started to get broken with me starting to care for people who like to write to full disks. I frikkin' HATE this rat race! I'm even starting to SHOUT. Now, the code prefers to write no header at all (when there is no actual output) instead of possibly writing too many misleading ones. Getting the blame for breaking dir2ogg repeatedly while trying to cope with one fatal situation that you cannot really cope with sucks. Big time. I hope that's it now!
.</p>
.<p>The silent version 1.15.2 introduced a compatibility fix for the configure script. Get the new release from the usual places.</p>

:title Leapfrog: mpg123 1.15.1 is here.
.<p>Been some time, time to release the next mpg123. There was a 1.15.0 release, but a very quiet one since two bugs immediately jumped up. Now there is 1.15.1 right away, with those goodies:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 API version 37</li>
.<li>Fix corner case in HTTP communication with missing path in Location header (<a href="/bugs/187">bug 187</a>).</li>
.<li>Prevent nasty alignment issues by not guessing about assembler alignment when .balign is available (<a href="/bugs/188">bug 188</a>).</li>
.<li>Added --continue (also see scripts/conplay).</li>
.<li>Added number row to terminal control keys for 10% jump points (for navigating long tracks).</li>
.<li>Set xterm title always if asked, disregarding the -q switch (if you want fully quiet, don't specify --title).</li>
.<li>Enable terminal mode in OS/2 by explicitly checking for and using os2term library.</li>
.<li>Getting WAV/AU/CDR writing back to a sane state while still catching out-of-disk when writing headers (none in case of CDR) but removing that initial test that prevented writing on any non-seekable file (like, /dev/stdout to a pipe).</li>
.<li>Added native audio output for QNX (thanks to Mike Gorchak), also improving portability of configure script while at that.</li>
.<li>more robust recovery from ALSA issues (device suspend)</li>
.<li>Fix crash in module loader on *BSD.</li>
.<li>Extend time display to switch to hours above 60 minutes (hh:mm:ss, ditching the sub-second precision)</li>
.<li>really include dithering in default x86-64 build.</li>
.<li>Fix mpg123_scan() not properly seeking back for all types of files (<a href="/bugs/3582628">bug 3582628</a> ... it got a different number on sf.net now ... brilliant, folks!).</li>
.<li>Prevent false positives for "Frankenstein!" when using mpg123_scan().</li>
.<li>Fix printing of negative positions with buffer (<a href="/bugs/186">bug 186</a>).</li>
.<li>Accept application/x-scpls as additional MIME type.</li>
.<li>Try to handle certain Windows toolchains that miss EOVERFLOW.</li>
.</ul>
.<p>So, don't hesitate to grab the fresh one from the  <a href="/download.shtml">download section</a>!</p>
.<p><strong>Update:</strong> We got Windows binaries uploaded, the 64 bit ones built for generic x86-64 CPUs (not just Core i7).</p>

:title Fix it, already! Releasing mpg123 1.14.4 .
.<p>Here we go again with another regression-fixing release: That happens when you skimp on verifying your ground-breaking reworking of existing code. Now, the resync logic does not signal premature end of stream on bad headers, short seeks don't get bit reservoir unnecessarily cleared and sample-accurate seek for files without gapless meta data is accurate again.</p>
.<p>Please upgrade to mpg123 1.14.4. Really, please do grap the update from the usual <a href="/download.shtml">download</a> locations.</p>

:title Writing WAV to standard out again with mpg123 1.14.2
.<p>With the 1.14 series, in an attempt to better handle out-of-disk situations, the WAV writing code got changed and that broke writing of WAVs to standard output (raw data with a single WAV header in front). This shall work again with the current release.</p>
.<p>Upgrade if you please.</p>

:by Thomas
:title The mandatory follow-up: mpg123 1.14.1
.<p>This one fixes a bug that got uncovered with the (modest) reorganization of the parser code. With the feeder API, it was possible to miss a format change in the (damaged) stream, the more dire outcome being the allocated output buffer being too small (switching from MPEG layer 3 with 576 samples per frame to 1152 samples per frame).</p>
.<p>Upgrade naturally encouraged.</p>

:title Finally! It is here! It. Is. Here! Behold mpg123 version 1.14.0!
.<p>This is a rather big update, with a good number of fixes and behavioural improvements. You want a list? Here we go:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 API version 36 (see NEWS.libmpg123)</li>
.<li>Add --ignore-streamlength.</li>
.<li>But also deal with concatenated (Frankenstein) streams: Not applying gapless cutting once we're over the announced number of frames.</li>
.<li>Add --lyrics for printout of lyrics (from USLT in ID3v2).</li>
.<li>Added handling of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSER2 to terminal control code, configurable via --ctrlusr1 and --ctrlusr2.</li>
.<li>Some low-level API added (mpg123_framedata(), mpg123_framepos(), buffering and resampling control).</li>
.<li>Added info about input buffer fill to mpg123_getstate().</li>
.<li>ReplayGain: Try to detect LAME below 3.95 for the different reference level of 83 dB (adding preamp of 6 dB). Version 3.95 itself (not 3.95.1) I cannot detect. User-set gain values are not touched.</li>
.<li>Keep silent about missing bit reservoir when ignoring frames. That is the whole point (mostly;-).</li>
.<li>Add the new/old WRITE_SAMPLE variant from MPlayer that makes the generic decoder faster on older CPUs (x86 at least). Not on x86-64, though (it's not enabled per default there).</li>
.<li>Handle out-of-disk in the file writers (a bit, see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=67259)</li>
.<li>Added Xcode project files to build libmpg123 on Mac OS and iOS</li>
.<li>32 bit output for sndio output (patch by Brad Smith).</li>
.<li>Remote control interface knows LOADLIST command now.</li>
.<li>Now freeing meta data memory after printout.</li>
.<li>Some documentation cleanup, including manpage fixes by quadrispro.</li>
.<li>Re-enabled wildcard expansion on Windows (been broken by unicode file name support).</li>
.<li>Fix MMX tabinit syntax (thanks to Marcel Müller for pointing that out).</li>
.<li>Fix SGI audio output (been broken since change to modules).</li>
.<li>Fix some fringe behaviour (mpg123_getformat() triggering needless reading of next frame, possibly hitting bogus MPG123_NEED_MORE).</li>
.<li>Resync limit now also serves to increase amount of skipped junk on beginning.</li>
.<li>Better separation of stream end and read error (in case there is no stream opened, even).</li>
.<li>Don't always complain about failed free format header search (only with verbosity level 3).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>Well, what more to say? Of course you are going to grab the update from the usual <a href="/download.shtml">download</a> locations. There is something in it for everyone;-)</p>

.- Add --lyrics for printout of lyrics (from USLT in ID3v2).
.- But also deal with concatenated (Frankenstein) streams:

:title Beta time!
.<p>
.There is a beta of the next mpg123 release, 1.14 --- please get it, test it and report any issues! Main source of trouble might be the new handling of concatenated streams that start out with a Xing/Info header that contains gapless info (which doesn't really fit the conglomerate). But there is more, too. I'm short on time so here is the NEWS, rather verbatim:
.</p>
.<pre>
.- Add --ignore-streamlength.
.- But also deal with concatenated (Frankenstein) streams:
.  Not applying gapless cutting once we're over the announced number of frames.
.- Added handling of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSER2 to terminal control code,
.  configurable via --ctrlusr1 and --ctrlusr2.
.- Some low-level API added (mpg123_framedata(), mpg123_framepos()).
.- Accept application/octet-stream from HTTP, assuming it's MPEG data.
.- Added info about input buffer fill to mpg123_getstate().
.- Fix build without feeder.
.- Info frame ReplayGain fixes:
.  - Fix parsing of audiophile ReplayGain from Info tag (perhaps relevant
.    for the future, yet have to see a file that has that value present).
.  - Fix parsing of any ReplayGain value from Info tag! All these years
.    and nobody told me that we used only the last 5 bits, not 9?!
.    I'm to blame, too: I use RVA values from ID3v2 tags... this is surreal.
.  - Detect LAME below 3.95 for the different reference level of 83 dB
.    (adding preamp of 6 dB). Version 3.95 itself (not 3.95.1) I cannot detect.
.    User-set gain values are not touched.
.- Keep silent about missing bit reservoir when ignoring frames.
.  That is the whole point (mostly;-).
.- Add the new/old WRITE_SAMPLE variant from MPlayer that makes the generic

:title We want to be faster!
.<p>
.As you might know, some time ago I contributed a mpg123 binding for <a href="http://mplayerhq.hu">MPlayer</a> to replace the fork there, called mp3lib. The final adoption of this mpg123 binding depends on some eerie performance issue being resolved. Mpg123 is slower than an old fork of itself! Well, that is the case when used as library from MPlayer...
.</p>
.<p>
.I sent out a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=20111010210331.0955d99b%40orgis.org&forum_name=mpg123-devel">call on the mpg123-devel list</a> to find someone who can help out with fixing this performance issue since I lack the time for that, sadly. If you feel motivated, please join the discussion there. Alternatively you can just send the fix to me personally, too. I won't mind;-)
.</p>
.<p>
.<strong>Update:</strong> I am trying to investigate this with the time I can (not, actually) spare. I am documenting this with my <a href="/beating_mp3lib_in_mplayer/">notes about Beating mp3lib in MPlayer</a>. Suggestions welcome.

.<li>Fix crash when calling mpg123_decoder() before opening a track -- a rare use case since one can choose a decoder with mpg123_new() already.</li>
.<li>Fix format change detection for certain (artificial) concatenated streams (p.ex. MPEG 1 frames following MPEG 2 frames).</li>
.<li>Prevent the nasty of <a href="/bugs/3154889">bug 3154889</a>: No change of pitch without a current audio format. No proper solution, but more like earlier behaviour.</li>

:title mpg123 in the FOSS world
.<p>There are some things going on that I'd like to remind the world and myself on:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>The ffmpeg project could still profit from getting a libmpg123 wrapper: <a href="http://multimedia.cx/eggs/gcc-of-multimedia/">ffmpeg audio decoder performance comparison</a>. Now a question is: Which fork of ffmpeg? I remember Michael saying that he won't oppose a wrapper when it's maintained, while Diego stronly argued for actually moving mpg123 code into ffmpeg and ditch any separate specialized library.</li>
.<li>GStreamer apps could also profit from getting libmpg123 mojo -- and there is <a href="http://gst.homeunix.net/">a libmpg123 plugin for GStreamer</a>, which apparently just needs some polish. See discussion at <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=558235">GNOME / Rhythmbox</a> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/rhythmbox/+bug/290150">launchpad bug for Rhythmbox</a></li>
.</ul>
.<p>Indeed, after getting some mpg123 into XMMS2 and MPlayer (try -ac mpg123 on a recent build) ... ffmpeg and GStreamer are two influential multimedia frameworks that we also should be part of.</p>

.<p>Just as the 12th day of the 12th month of this year gives way to the 13th, the mpg123 1.12 series gives way to the mpg123 1.13 series. And this we got for you:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 API version 29 (mpg123_encsize(), MPG123_SKIP_ID3V2, mpg123_strlen(), 24 bit output, ARM decoder)</li>
.<li>New optimization: <strong>ARM NEON (Cortex A series)</strong> -- kudos to Taihei, again!</li>
.<li>Added 24 bit integer output (truncation of 32 bit integer)</li>
.<li>Cleanup of symbols for the static library: Only have global symbols that are actually needed, prefix them with INT123_ to avoid conflicts.</li>
.<li>Added --streamdump to get a copy of the data libmpg123 used.</li>
.<li>Added --icy-interval and tweaked libmpg123 to make playback of ICY stream dumps possible.</li>
.<li>Added possibility to set module file suffix at build -- to be able to avoid .la files for plugins.</li>
.<li>Removed compiler directives for alignment and disable associated tests.<br />
.  The tests don't work on a wide range of compilers anyway, and newer gccs
.  do have force_align_arg_pointer to fix bad stacks.</li>
.<li>There is no ChangeLog file anymore... it was autogenerated from subversion log anyway, so look there if interested.</li>
.</ul>
.Have fun with that ... unless hordes of bugs come screaming at us, consider this this year's christmas (or winter solstice, if you please) present from the mpg123 team;-)

.<li>Various build and portability fixes (including making some exotic configure switches work (again)).</li>
.<li>Add dump_seekindex example</li>
.<li>Sync mpg123_clr (.NET wrapper) to 1.12 feature set, patch provided by Malcolm Boczek -- and actually include it in release tarball!</li>
.<li>Rework mpg123.h logic for large file stuff a bit, clients can control it by defining MPG123_NO_LARGENAME or MPG123_LARGESUFFIX.</li>
.<li>Include dumb wrappers to provide names suffixed with _64 on 64 bit machines and _32 on 32 bit machines, respectively, to help clients that insist on defining _FILE_OFFSET_BITS where it is not needed (or with a non-large value).</li>
.<li>Tuning of the internal buffer code for feeder mode to minimize its performance impact (works in 4K blocks now).</li>
.<li>Workaround for compiler bugs in Open64/PathScale/SunStudio (<a href="/bugs/3004396">bug 3004396</a>, suggestion by Doug Gilmore). <br />
.  Note that Sun Studio is still a tricky fellow, at least when it comes to our preprocessed assembly (generic build works).
.  Also, x86-Open64 recently produced another segfault in layer3.c on my box... GNU and intel compilers are what one can use as something stable.</li>
.<li>Make mpg123_getformat() return more error codes (like MPG123_NEED_MORE).</li>
.<li>Fix handle I/O for clients with small file offset (32 bit when libmpg123 has 64 bit).</li>
.<li>Fix 3DNow(Ext) standalone builds.</li>

.<p>I uploaded a quick hack that turns two instances of mpg123 and a MIDI controller (in this case the rather inexpensive M-Audio XSession pro) into a simple live DJ set: See the <a href="/download/mpg123-midi-control.c">source code of mpg123-midi-control</a>.
.I'll cut out the guts of the comment header to make this little post complete:</p>
.<p>
.        This is a hacky proof of concept for getting my M-Audio XSession pro to excert some effect on mpg123, on Linux systems with ALSA sequencer API.
.
.        The idea is to run two instances of mpg123 like that:
.</p>
.<pre>mpg123 -R --fifo /dev/shm/mpg123-1
.mpg123 -R --fifo /dev/shm/mpg123-2
.</pre>
.<p>
.        Then run this program here with a playlist (listing of absolute file paths) from STDIN
.</p>
.<pre>cat absolute-playlist | ./mpg123-control /dev/shm/mpg123-1 /dev/shm/mpg123-2
.</pre>
.<p>
.        and connect it to the MIDI controller (adjust port numbers):
.</p>
.<pre>aconnect 20:0 129:0</pre>
.<p>
.        With that setup, you will load tracks from the playlist with the eject buttons for the respective channel, start/stop playback with the play/pause buttons... the volume and pitch faders will do something you might expect... the EQ buttons change the EQ settings.
.        In short: You have a nifty basic DJ setup on your PC with two plain instances of mpg123.
.</p><p>
.        Note that the pitching only works in a range the hardware or your audio output support (i.e. ALSA dmix)... and you need to be able to open two audio outputs at once, at different rates (ALSA dmix can do that... but it rather stresses the CPU -- though on modern machines you might not notice).
.        Anyhow, it is just a fun proof-of-concept to be able to get some reaction out of my MIDI toy.
.</p>
.<p>It works rather well... of course the pitching is not optimal, since mpg123 re-opens the audio output for every pitch change, but the volume/fader and EQ controls work nicely. If you're into this stuff, you should now have a simple example to adapt to your gear
.(different MIDI controllers might just need changes to the numerical constants naming the controllers and buttons).</p>

:title A large déjà vu: mpg123 1.12.0 fixes the future for large file support, again.
.<p>Please forget the previous release, 1.11.0 . The libmpg123_64.so it introduced on largefile-sensitive systems is gone now. The interfaces for applications using system default file offsets and those using enabled large file support are unified in one libmpg123.so now.
.Version 1.12.0 of mpg123 shall mark the first stable ABI for such systems since mpg123 1.4.x, after which libmpg123.so usually offered only the interface for large files. Please, please: Update to this one so that emerging users of libmpg123 do not get bitten by an inconsistent base of mpg123 installations with incompatible libraries.</p>
.<p>As a side effect of dual mode hacking, replacement I/O using client-provided handles (void pointer) has been added to the API. Oh, and the introduction of AI_ADDRCONFIG has been made conditional based on the actual availability of that flag on a system (that helps OpenBSD).</p>
.<p><a href="/download.shtml">Download mpg123</a> version 1.12.0 now!</p>
.<p><strong>Update:</strong>In 1.12.0, there was still a passage in INSTALL referring to the twin libraries, I changed that and released 1.12.1 -- there are no changes in the code.</p>

:title Another round in the war with large files: Please test the all-fresh mpg123 snapshot with dual-mode large file support.
.<p>Dear people interested in the magnificent mpg123,</p>
.<p>since the 1.11.0 release brougt the combined confused anger of the world directed against me for my simple and clean (for the maintainer) approach to ABI stability, the "twinlibs" libmpg123.so and libmpg123_64.so, I spent another couple of days/nights on fixing the mess that is large file support on Linux/Solaris.</p>
.<p>Under <a href=snapshot>http://mpg123.org/snapshot</a> , you now find a preview on what may become mpg123 1.12.0, featuring dual-mode libmpg123. I really tried to keep all the funny and complicated aspects of the API working with a 32bit-offset app using a libmpg123 with large file support. The bold and fearless are invited to look at <a href="http://mpg123.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/src/libmpg123/lfs_wrap.c?view=markup">my approach at a dual-mode layer</a>, this file is the main part of that.<br />
.Everyone is invited, humbly requested, barely expected to check out the snapshot tarball to build mpg123 plus library and verify that the dual-large-file mode really works.</p>
.<p>My regression tests look good, I also created a >2G mp3 file and verified that I can play it as stream with a small-file mpg123 binary using a large-file-enabled libmpg123, but API calls hitting the limit of 32 bit file offsets fail as expected, in a controlled manner.</p>
.<p>I do want to do it right this time, so please give me (ideally, mpg123-devel or mpg123-users mailing list) feedback and opinions about this upcoming release of mpg123!</p>

:title What a fuss. Large files suck, don't they?
.<p>
.Reactions to my split of small and large file libmpg123 are mostly irritated, confused ... or even hostile. Too sad that mpg123 does not have enough outreach to have people complaining about the test release two weeks ago, before I made it official.
.Now there are facts and the world does not like them. I am in discussion with someone knowing that largefile business and perhaps he can help me to come to a conclusion. Maybe I'll do dual mode in the end, supporting 32 and 64 bit offsets from one library. So stay tuned... something will happen in the next days. I don't promise what, though.
.</p>
.<p>
.To mirror the anger and frustration I met out there, I want to express my anger and frustration about the whole 64on32 large file mess. I hate it. I hate it that I fell into the trap of making the mpg123 API rely on shape-shifting off_t (but at the same time feel that it is still correct, by concept -- would off_t be a stable entity). I'll try to find a solution nevertheless. But I hate it. Free software is not always fun. Not at all.

:title mpg123 1.11.0 by large -- re-issued
.<p>
.<strong>Attention:</strong> The initial source package was missing the crucial changes for the library name.
.I uploaded a corrected version around 2010-03-21 22:30 CET. Please get a fresh one if you got your download earlier than that.
.</p>
.<p>
.So, here it is: The mpg123 release that hopefully causes only small trouble now, but will be safe for the future regarding the mess that is the hybrid setup of small and large file support on certain systems (like GNU/Linux and Solaris on x86). If your system does optional large file support, a build of libmpg123 with that enabled will be called libmpg123_64.so, a default build with small file support will be called just libmpg123.so like before.<br />
.Note that default means that what you get when not giving special flags or preprocessor defines -- the configure script will detect the optional large file support and enable it by default, thus, changing from the system default. Confused? Right.
.</p>
.<p>
.But there are some goodies without side effect, too:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Support for HTTP streams in Windows builds of mpg123.</li>
.<li>More foolproof IPv6 behaviour (not asking for IPv6 connections when there are no suitable interfaces).</li>
.<li>Fix a potential reading problem with ICY streams.</li>
.<li>Assembler cleanup that will enable optimized builds with the Sun compiler once it got a certain bug fixed.</li>
.</ul>
.<p>So, get the new <a href="/download/mpg123-1.11.0.tar.bz2">mpg123-1.11.0 source</a> and be happy (possibly after relinking some apps).</p>

:date 2010-03-10

:title Working on a stable future for large file support (again).
.<p>The optional large file support on Linux/Solaris still troubles the mpg123 project. Of course the troubles started with me unwittingly choosing to expose off_t in the API.
.From mpg123-1.5.0 on up to the recently released 1.10.1, I at least opted to prevent runtime damage by renaming API functions according to the selection in large file support.
.This, again, is not a good idea when leaving the library name unchanged: A new build with large file support actually exposes a different ABI and thus is not compatible with an old binary.</p>
.<p>So, here is my second attempt on getting the situation predictable: Not just some symbols, the whole library gets renamed when large file support is enabled. You get libmpg123_64 instead of libmpg123.
.That means a one-time incompatible switch for any binary that depends on a libmpg123 with 64 bit file offsets (on the affected systems),
.but it preserves compatibility for older and future binaries that depend on &quot;default&quot; file offset size (that is, 32 bit on a 32 bit Linux system). It hurts once, but after the switch, we have, if not a pretty, but at least predictable vision of the future.</p>
.<p>If nobody comes up with a better idea (no, supporting 32 bit and 64 bit offsets in one build is not considered better... it's not worth the maintenance work and is error-prone, in my view), the next release of mpg123 will bring the change of library name depending on enabled large file support.</p>
.<p><strong>So please test it and be prepared, perhaps give some comments about it:</strong> <a href="/download/mpg123-1.11.0-dev_largefile.tar.bz2">mpg123-1.11.0 preview for the large file name change</a></p>
.<p>To all users of systems that are not sensitive to variable off_t size (most non-Linux/Solaris, 64 bit systems): Be happy and do not worry about this mess. For anyone who wants to worry and understand the issue, have a read of <a href="http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/largefile/">Guido Draheim's work on the matter</a>.</p>
.<p><strong>And, not to forget, there are other goodies with mpg123-1.11.0:</strong> Also concerning portability and ABI stability, the SSE code does not rely on aligned variables on the stack anymore.
.At least that is the idea behind doing all explicit alignments now on the heap with pointer arithmetic -- as a side effect, I have seen speedup from that change, too.<br />
.Then, we got enhancements of the networking code, enabling network streams for plain Windows builds (MinGW) and fixing sub-optimal behaviour with respect to IPv6 (not asking for IPv6 name resolution unless there are IPv6 interfaces configured).</p>

:title mpg123 1.10.1 - the most wanted maintenance release
.<p>GNU/Linux distributions that employ multilib will really want to upgrade to this one because, after elaborate debates on various bug trackers (<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20042">wine</a> and <a href=" http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=299490">gentoo</a>, at least), I finally disarmed the largefile consistency check in the mpg123 header. It was not compatible with multilib setups that failed to provide a separate header for 32 bit (with explicitly enabled large file support) and 64 bit (large file support implicit).</p>
.<p>Of course, that is not all. More to the core of mpg123, there are important bug fixes for gapless decoding and the feeder mode of the library (reliable  handling of garbage and (apparent) free format streams). The full list of goodies:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Help multilib setups that boldly assume that headers are invariant by removing the consistency check in mpg123.h and instead just adding a suffix to relevant functions when _FILE_OFFSET_BITS is defined. Invalid setups will now fail at the linking stage instead of the preprocessing stage.
.  That should cover <a href="/bugs/2934488">bug 2934488</a>.</li>
.<li>Fixes for gapless decoding:
.<ul>
.  <li>Correctly skip padding larger than one MPEG frame (strange, but occurs).</li>
.  <li><a href="/bugs/2950218">Bug 2950218</a> (proper gapless cuts for seeking near the end).</li>
.</ul></li>
.<li>Make sure the search for the first header aborts after 64K of one-byte reads, as always intended (<a href="/bugs/2951334">bug 2951334</a>).<br />
.  Certain files (or even random data) were able to fool mpg123 sufficiently enough that it basically reads through the whole file in 1-byte steps in search for MPEG data.
.  The limit of 64K will very likely be configurable in a future mpg123 version.</li>
.<li>Fix subtle bug with seeking in feeder mode: A seek close to the current position (meaning: the needed data offset is already in mpg123's buffer chain) resulted in skipped bytes.</li>
.<li>Improve the feeder mode for handling large amounts of junk at the beginning, including proper passing of the request for more data when trying to determine free format frame size. This also fixes endless looping as reported in <a href="/bugs/2951334">bug 2951334</a>.</li>
.<li>The parser code still needs overhaul. It is not pretty.</li>
.<li>Compile fix for OpenAL (with strict compiler).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>You see, this upgrade is a no-brainer. I gets a number of bugs out of the way to add more fun stuff to the next release, 1.11.0 . Get it from the <a href="/download.shtml">usual places</a>.</p>
.<p>Update: I fixed the link to <a href="/current">current mpg123</a> to actually point to the current version. Oh, and, I must admit that indeed, mpg123 is to blame for an oversight regarding IPv6 support which can trouble you with your broken DNS server (DSL router):
.It asks for IPv6 name resolution even if your setup does not feature IPv6 interfaces... together with glibc 2.10, that is rather annoying (see the web for stories). A future release will fix that, but lacking time for that, I point to the svn trunk, which has it fixed, or this little patch that should apply to a reasonable number of past releases:</p>

:title version 1.10.1 pre-release number 3
.<p>The upcoming bugfix release is quite a prominent one, being focus of frantic attention mainly because of the trouble multilib systems have with the old large-file safety hack in the header.
.That safety hack is largely gone now -- with the header resulting in being identical for 32 bit and 64 bit mode on a multilib system.</p>
.<p>But there is more to it: There are important fixes for gapless decoding corner cases and improvements of the parser for bad files: prevent seemingly endless loop in search of first valid header and more so seemingly (at least) endless loop for the feeder mode.</p>
.<p>Get the <a href="/download/mpg123-1.10.1-prerelease3.tar.bz2">pre-release source code</a>, or the occasional binary from the <a href="/download/win64">win64 directory</a>, if you are so inclined. And yes, This could just be named 1.10.1-rc3 to be consistent with earlier practice, but I did not know at the first pre-release that it would become that official. Sorry, really. Now get up and test it so that we can do the release for good;-)</p>

:title The mpg123 version 1.10.0 is there!
.<p>Here's a list of the features and fixes in this release:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Confirmed/fixed on OS/2 platform.
.  At least a static build works with native audio output and generic decoder.</li>
.<li>Make modules work with libtool-2.2.6b .</li>
.<li>Added pitch command to control interface.</li>
.<li>HTTP header field and MIME type parsing now case-insensitive (fixes <a href="/bugs/2904736">bug 2904736</a>).
.  Also, the MIME-parsing for non-playlist URLs is done the same way as from playlists now.
.  And, we interpret MIME types only to before a ";" (see <a href="/bugs/2836904">bug 2836904</a>).</li>
.<li>There is a build-time option to enable unicode file names on windows now. UNIX (Linux) does not need that, UTF-8 works natively.
.  An unicode-enabled build of libmpg123 expects file names as UTF-8 strings, opening of non-utf8 strings (by old applications) still works via fallback when the conversion of the string or opening of the file failed.</li>
.<li>Also, on Windows, --realtime now works, along with added granularity of the new --priority parameter. Note that you get the latter functionality through nice/renice on UNIX, no need to add that to mpg123.</li>
.<li>Added experimental framebyframe API.</li>
.<li>Added a new Microsoft common language runtime wrapper (aka .NET wrapper) written by Malcolm Boczek. See ports\MSVC++\2008clr\mpg123clr\ReadMe.txt for further information</li>
.<li>Added Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 project files for libmpg123</li>
.<li>Updated autotools machinery, autogen.sh is gone, use `autoreconf -iv`.</li>
.</ul>

:title Another bugfix release. We care about bugs. We wanna squash them!
.<p>The simple facts:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Fix logic failure in gapless code: The trailing silence was only cut on the first decode. So, seek-back and decode again never was gapless:-(</li>
.<li>Fix linker flags on MacOS 10.6 .</li>
.<li>Improve portability (mainly for Solaris/x86, possibly others).</li>
.<li>Fix reading from standard input in Windows (use binary mode).</li>

.<p>Some bugs and regression fixes accumulated quickly in the lively mpg123 svn repository... so here is the mandatory update for 1.9.0:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Fix OpenAL output issue (<a href="/bugs/2840085">bug 2840085</a>)</li>
.<li>Fix theoretically possible discarding of some audio samples when getting a new format.</li>
.<li>Fix unwanted verboseness (some error messages from library even when MPG123_QUIET was specified).</li>
.<li>Fix back-to-beginning for feed_skip (fixes <a href="/bugs/2859531">bug 2859531</a>).</li>
.<li>Fix the CPU creep bug with NtoM decoding.<br /<
.That one has been nasty on you with large files since bad frame fillup has been introduced.</li>
.<li>Fix regression (since 1.9.0) in ID3 parsing: Now Foobar2000 RVA fields are interpreted again (among others).</li>
.<li>Fix some compiler warnings, minor cleanup.</li>

.Dither noise is now runtime-generated (so less bloated binary with dithered decoders, thus those are included by default now). Several bugs have been fixed, relating to UTF16 in ID3v2 tags and bad frame fillup for 8 bit samples. Generally the ID3v2 parser is more flexible now with encodings, libmpg123 also offering a switch to defer the transcoding to UTF8 (so that a client application can handle strange encodings in disguise).</p>

:title More goodness for upcoming 1.8.0
.<p>The release is still delayed, but just because it is becoming a better one, indeed! Apart from fixing regressions that hit layer 1 and layer 2 decoding since the 1.x series, there are improvements underway for 16bit accuracy as well. You may have noticed the MPEG compliance log included on the front page. That one is periodically created from the svn snapshot and for 1.8.0 it will indicate full ISO conformity also for 16bits output, where the mpg123 engine has been lacking in the LSB because of rounding (or lack of) in the generic decoder. Note that the i586 decoder already is correct in the LSB, it uses proper rounding in assembler.</p>

:title Regression fix: mpg123-1.7.3
.<p>While we eagerly anticipate the 1.8.0 release, there arose the need for a quick regression fix for 1.7.x . The re-introduction of workable --doublespeed introduced a fine regression wich basically made seeking unbearable. Why didn't anyone notice?

:title Bugfixes for flexible resampling with mpg123-1.6.4
.<p>
.This release fixes an issue with flexible resampling and the bad frame fill up introduced in the 1.6 series.
.Also, resampled output should now be consistent across seeks. Get it from the usual places...
.</p>
.<p>Addendum: Since 2009-01-13 there are also fresh Win32 binaries uploaded, by courtesy of fellow P4tr3ck.</p>

.<ul>
.<li>Fix sf.net bug #2413608: Make sure a new format does not slip through after early close.</li>
.<li>Include equalizer example file and a piece of wrapper code for MSVC++ in the distribution.</li>
.<li>Do not claim to support unsigned 16 bit encoding (never been the case).</li>
.<li>Fix default fifo detection, now it actally activates fifo support!</li>

:title Large File Fuss
.<p>
.I feel the need remind the world about the messy issue of large file support (sometimes called largefile support instead;-).
.There are certain systems (notably GNU/Linux and Solaris) that have chosen to make that a decision at build time with the type off_t sometimes being 32bit, sometimes 64bit.
.You can compile apps with or without large file support.
.</p>
.<p>
.That means that you can have libraries for 64bit file offsets on your system and libraries for 32bit offsets.
.You can have applications (trying to) using libraries with a different file offset setting.
.That means one thing: Trouble!
.To prevent weird runtime errors or even crashes, I added some precautions to libmpg123, notably at build time, you could see such a message:
.</p>
.<pre>
./usr/include/mpg123.h:37:2: error: #error "Mismatch in large file setup!
  Enable/disable large file support appropriately to use libmpg123."
.</pre>
.<p>
.Also, at runtime, a 64bit offset libmpg123 will fail with a program that is not aware of this -- yielding unresolved symbols due to renaming the affected functions with a suffix indicating 64bits.
.</p>
.<p>
.If you encounter this, please read up and think about that problem, and possibly complain to your OS distribution or the software project whose code is failing. Especially GNU/Linux distributions should be interested in making sure that they don't mix largefile builds with non-largefile code.
.</p>
.<p><strong>Update:</strong> See the <a href="/faq.shtml#lfs">FAQ</a>.</p>

:title New Chapter of the Neverending but Unnerving Tale of 1.6.0
.<p>Let's face it: This week is tight for me. Possibly too tight to make a release.</p>
.<p>Besides all that real life work stuff, there's demanding involvement in organizing and taking part in the fith Brandenburger Linux-Infotag in Potsdam, Germany (BLIT), on 1st November. Perhaps around (or shortly after...) that would be a good time to clean up the docs and push the beast out after all. May be a good idea to settle the ongoing streamlining of the Windows builds during the week, too.</p>
.<p>Oh, and, eh... did I mention the BLIT? If you happen to be not that far from the state of Brandenburg (you know, Berlin's at the center of it;-)... you might want to pay the BLIT a visit; see the <a href="http://blit.org">BLIT-Website</a> for details!</p>

.<p>Well, 1.6.0 is still not out. We are showing bad discipline and keep adding features. Sorry.</p>

.<p>...for final testers! Please check out the current <a href="snapshot">snapshot</a> and report any issues.
.I intend to release 1.6.0 around this weekend...</p>
.<p>A nice number of improvements accumulated:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>small things inside that I forgot to mention</li>
.<li>some new commands for remote control interface:
.  <ul>
.  <li>SCAN</li>
.  <li>SAMPLE</li>
.  <li>EQFILE</li>
.  <li>SHOWEQ</li>
.  </ul>
.</li>
.<li>added --keep-open command line flag (for remote control)</li>
.<li>fixed equalizer file parsing to really handle comment lines as example file suggests</li>
.<li>more elaborate detection of UTF-8 locale, also --utf8 switch to force it</li>
.<li>libmpg123 9.0.9:
.  <ul>
.  <li>added mpg123_geteq() and mpg123_tell_stream()</li>
.  <li>API cleanup (take const char* for mpg123_open())</li>
.  <li>calm down complainling (C++) compilers by completing the mpg123_channels enum</li>
.  <li>fixed several possible crashes when user provides NULLs where it isn't appropriate</li>
.  <li>workaround for frames that fail decoding (bad frame body, missing bit reservoir): fill up with silence</li>
.    That also fixes seeking issues related to bad frames since now the fixed relation between frame and sample offsets is restored.
.  <li>Finally realized what that the resampling code for integer math (generic_nofpu) was just incomplete!
.    Now it works, using the defined integer multiplication.</li>
.  <li>Detect UTF-8 in ICY conversion (instead of just assuming CP-1252, provided by Torsten Glaser).</li>
.  <li>Prevent ugly noise when the bit reservoir is not fully there (p.ex. ignorantly cut mp3 files).
.    Concerned frames are silenced, but reservoir for following frames is kept.
.    Thanks to Patrick Dehne for the investigation and patch!</li>
.  </ul>
.</li>
.<li>new project files to build/use libmpg123 with MSVC++ 2005 and 2008, provided by Patrick Dehne</li>
.<li>fixed a regression that made the pause/loop mode in terminal control slowly go backwards</li>
.</ul>

.<p>
.As promised, version 1.5.1 is now out, featuring the 4 announced bug fixes (see news archive and tracker).
.One may note that with this version we seem to have taken all technical steps to make the XMMS2 plugin official (though the code in mpg123 distribution is outdated, there is the fresh stuff from XMMS2 folks).

:title I-Pee, I-Pee!
.<p>The world shatters as version 1.5.0 of mpg123 is being released - now supporting IPv6 officially (a fresh implementation, after that other patch floating around for years...)!</p>
.<p>But that is not the only change we got there... various features/fixes on different scales went into this one:</p>
.<ul>
.<li> libmpg123 6.0.6
.<ul>
.  <li>Floating point decoding back again, (build time choice for now; --with-cpu=generic_float).</li>
.  <li>More robust string handling; extended string API.</li>
.  <li>fixed an (so far) unnoticed ID3 bug that may have obscured comment fields</li>
.  <li>added mpg123_feed() as shortcut; using const input buffer now</li>
.  <li>resync is enabled again for ICY streams (the trouble in the past was due to a reader bug, not the streams)</li>
.  <li>decode ICY text data to UTF-8 (thanks, Thorsten)</li>
.  <li>preserve file flags for timeout mode</li>
.</li></ul>
.<li> More elaborate (helpful?) error message for output format problems.</li>
.<li> Reworked HTTP code... and added IPv6 support!</li>
.<li> Fix the --proxy parameter (has been accidentally ignored before).</li>
.<li> Added --ignore-mime to work with web streams with funny playlist MIME types like "audio/megurl".</li>
.<li> Know MIME audio/mpegurl.</li>
.<li> --timeout is now also used for the connection itself (not just reading).</li>
.<li> Now trying to resume ALSA device after suspend.</li>
.<li> subtle build changes (your CFLAGS rule now)</li>

:title Glory days!
.<p>There are two important announcements to bring to you, favoured public:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>mpg123 1.x is in debian lenny (testing)! That means the next stable debian version will have a current mpg123 with libmpg123 as shared lib. That is <em>good</em>:-)</li>
.<li>I finally came around and reworked the http code to be able to update the stuff to support IPv6 (like some patch already did quite some time ago).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.The latter especially means that I need people to test the heck out of the current <a href="/snapshot">development snapshot</a> to find all the nice little bugs I introduced. Seriously: I need you people test the code for IPv4 and IPv6. Please. Test. And. Report to the devel mailing list or just directly to the maintainer.

:title Get your fix with 1.4.3!
.<p>We had a couple of nice little bugs to fix for this one.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Fix mpg123_tell() and mpg123_seek() return values with respect to the samples in decoding buffer (<a href="/bugs/1947373">bug 1947373</a>).</li>
.<li>Fix (bogus) 3DNow detection on IDT C6 (<a href="/bugs/1947982">bug 1947982</a>).</li>
.<li>Fix mono playback of win32 output (<a href="/bugs/1955157">bug 1955157</a>).</li>
.<li>Fix ABI compatibility with compilers that don't align the stack like gcc does (fixing SSE crashes on win32).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>So users of IDT CPUs, serious users of libmpg123 and any users of Windows systems (there are fresh binaries available) really would like to upgrade to the new release.</p>

.<p>The new release is there, adding essentially one convenience feature and one serious bug fix, here's the list:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Enable runtime check for available and working output modules.<br />
.  Now mpg123 tries all built modules (or a list specified in mpg123 -o moda,modb,modc) in turn to find a working output.
.  This minimizes the situation of having to specify a device when default output doesn't work for some reason.
.  See <a href="/bugs/1910500">bug 1910500</a>.</li>
.<li>libmpg123 2.2.2
.  <ul>
.  <li>Fixing an endless loop for ICY streams that suddenly end without error (just EOF).</li>
.  <li>Further fixes around EOF handling in (buffered/ICY) streams.</li>
.  </ul></li>
.<li>Enable user to interrupt mpg123 when stuck in a loop of failing to open a track (with --loop).</li>
.<li>This time with correct RPM spec (hopefully... sorry, Michael!).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>In less words: Get it!</p>

:title A little fix for old Alsa: 1.3.1
.<p>
.This bugfix release just revives that snd_pcm_sw_params_set_xfer_align(pcm, sw, 1) for alsa-lib < 1.0.16 .
.The ALSA changelog just mentions removal of that function and that noone really understood why it's really there... well, it at least seems to be necessary for alsa-lib 1.0.14 on some systems.

:title The enhanced mpg123 in version 1.3.0!
.<p>
.This is a major fix/enhancement release for http streaming, much more usable for that than earlier mpg123 1.x versions.
.But that is not all: We have important bugfixes for decoding and ID3v2 parsing plus a new option for smoother experience with buffered playback.
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 libtool-version 2.0.2
.	<ul>
.		<li>Fix nasty bug in ICY reader that failed to account for partial reads from slower network.</li>
.		<li>Now non-seekable streams can get peek-ahead for MPEG sync, too, triggered by the MPG123_SEEKBUFFER flag.</li>
.		<li>Do not try to resync on streams with ICY metadata, that won't work.<br />
.			Consequently, if there's unreliable network, use --loop -1 to make mpg123 reconnect to the server on errors.</li>
.		<li>Applying a few layer 3 decoder fixes from old mhipp CVS (hail to the creator;-)<br />
.			That includes the fix for <a href="/bugs/1895025">bug 1895025</a>.</li>
.		<li>Fix ID3v2 parser with very invalid claimed ID3v2 frame sizes (could have triggered DOS before).</li>
.		<li>Oh, and fixed a steady memory leak in ID3 handling. Should mention that;-)</li>
.	</ul>
.<li>Print ICY-NAME and ICY-URL again, as mpg123-0.6x did.</li>
.<li>Added --smooth option for not flusing buffer between tracks but at program end only.</li>
.<li>Included some contributed ports/bindings of libmpg123 under ports/ .</li>
.</ul>
.<p>You are already heading for the <a href="/download.shtml">download</a> section, aren't you? ;-)</p>

.A little taste of routine... treating some issues with this release:
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 libtool-version 1.2.1 (coincidence!)
.	<ul>
.		<li>Earlier check for free format headers to prevent them from screwing up resync (free format still not supported).</li>
.		<li>Bug 1889051: more flexible resync, not insisting on the format of the first frame (which could have been bogus).</li>
.	</ul></li>
.	<li>Add an output write loop to handle SIGSTOP/CONT operation (<a href="/bugs/1890563">bug 1890563</a>).</li>

:title Updating again: mpg123-1.2.0!
.<p>And here is the next incremental update, fixing some bugs, mainly in the build system, and adding the resync limit parameter to libmpg123 and the mpg123 app. There is convenience for RPM Linux distro users: You can run rpmbuild -tb on the mpg123 release tarball and get a qick-and-dirty rpm for installation though the included spec file.</p>
.<p>An embarrassing omission has been fixed, too: The i486 decoder files now actually are included in the distribution!</p>
.<p>
.So, head over to Sourceforge and get the stuff.

.<li>Terminal control:</li>
.<ul>
.<li>Key for going to previous track ([d], because it's left of [f] usually... no config file yet for that).</li>
.<li>Key for printing current playlist, [l].</li>
.<li>Now possible to switch on verbosity also for mpg123 -q -C</li>
.<li>Key for (re)printing ID3 tag info ([t]).</li>
.<li>Key for (re)printing MPEG frame header info ([m]).</li>

.<p>
.Some fixes went into the 1.0rc3 during the week, but the substance is unchanged.
.It is time to release the stable version 1.0.0!
.Get the tarball from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&package_id=148937&release_id=563661"> Sourceforge</a> or the local <a href="/download.shtml">download page</a> and enjoy.
.</p>
.<p>
.This is, finally, the first "complete" stable release of the revived mpg123 project.
.The 0.6x series already added a GNU autotool'ed build system and runtime cpu optimization selection, together with numerous bug fixes .and an enhanced generic control interface.
.</p><p>
.Now a big step has been taken, adding a re-born decoder library to replace the old mpglib (libmpg123) and support for run-time audio .output selection, which was one usability advantage mpg321 had over mpg123.
.Nearly every part of the mpg123 source has seen some restructuring or cleanup.
.</p>
.<p>
.The development from 0.6x to 1.0.0 also saw several smaller feature additions - make sure you check mpg123 --longhelp for anything you do not know already;-).

.<p>
.Quite a few fixes and improvements went into the second release candidate.
.ID3 handling is safer now and IDv2 support has been added to the remote control interface.
.The buffer and general output code got much attention, so that, among others, the buffer now works properly on MacOSX, write errors to .output are handled now and the interactive experience with the buffer and terminal control has been improved.
.Another important, albeit a bit embarrassing, point: Flexible rate mode should now work at all again.

:title 1.0rc2 is still immanent
.<p>
.I don't want to rush it while I am not in full posession of my mind... i.e. in the middle of the night after doing last changes.
.So, there will be 1.0rc2 not this night, but the next (this) day.
.</p>
.<p>
.The impatient may check out the updated <a href="/mpg123-svn-snapshot.tar.bz2">SVN snapshot</a> to see what 1.0rc2 will be.

:title 1.0rc2 is immanent
.<p>
.The first release canditate has been a huge success so far... a success in finding stuff to be fixed for the final 1.0!
.Well, we have so much new/reworked code in there that this should not come as a surprise.
.There will be 1.0rc2 this night, being a much more mature piece of software than 1.0rc1 just days ago.

:title It is here! Oh my mind! <strong>mpg123-1.0rc1</strong>
.<p>
.		The first release candidate of the heavily reworked mpg123 is ready! Grab it from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&package_id=148937&release_id=559279">Sourceforge</a> or from <a href="/download.shtml">the download page</a>.
.		Please test, especially to help us improve the situation with the specific platforms we cannot test; see <a href="testing.shtml">the testing page</a> for that!
.</p>
.<p>A glimpse into the news:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>In one word: LOTS!</li>
.<li>Many small things that happened while migrating to the   
.  new setup.</li>
.<li>The decoder is now a library (libmpg123) which can be 
.  installed also for other programs to use.<br />
.  This finally provides a heavily improved replacement for 
.  the aged mpglib. We have doxygen API doc, example codes.
.  You can still choose to compile the decoder statically 
.  into the mpg123 binary, though.</li>
.<li>We have a plugin system for audio output! This should be 
.  relieving to package maintainers for binary 
.  distributions, drastically reducing the number of builds 
.  they have to provide.<br />
.  Here, too, you can choose to build one audio output into 
.  the binary like before; you can have your old-school one-
.  piece mpg123 or the hip I-am-legion shared-lib-and-
.  plugin flexible mpg123;-)<br />
.  One exception: For now, you have to compile without   
.  modules in MinGW32/MSYS/Cygwin.</li>
.<li>ID3v2 support has been enhanced and, in the case of 
.  specific comments (those with a description), fixed.
.  The ID3 parsing is part of libmpg123, offering support 
.  for virtually all textual information in ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3 
.  and ID3v2.4 tags (along with the usual 128 bytes of 
.  ID3v1 or ID3v1.1 in a block).<br />
.  All tag texts are converted to UTF-8, allowing mpg123 to 
.  properly display special chars in an Unicode terminal 
.  without fuzz (for non-UTF locales, there is still the 
.  ASCII reduction).</li>
.<li>Gapless decoding (of layer 3 streams) is now considered 
.  to be a standard feature and is enabled per default both 
.  at build- and runtime.</li>
.<li>...</li>
.</ul>

:title Traces of 1.0
.<p>As you know (if you cared;-), we are feverishly working on the big-o-1.0 release of mpg123 featuring output plugins and a new decoder library.
.Besides the <a href="/mpg123-svn-snapshot.tar.bz2">nightly snapshots</a> we now have a preview of the <a href="/api/">libmpg123 API documentation</a>, thanks to Nick introducing doxygen. We think it looks nice already:-)</p>
.<p>
.Also, I came around producing preview builds of libmpg123 as Win32 DLL using MinGW, by popular demand. See the <a href="/download.shtml">download section</a> for that.

.<p>
.Bug <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1807964&group_id=135704&atid=733194">1807964</a> needed some squashing. It has been there far too long, hidden in the dark corners of not-quite-standard MPEG 2.5 playback.
.Be quick and get it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&package_id=148937&release_id=551837">sf.net project download section</a> and enjoy your sub-16Khz files;-)
.</p>
.<p>
.Meanwhile, we are urging to get going in the 1.0 direction. We need <a href="testing.shtml">testing</a> and inevitable fixing of changed code on various platforms to make the next major release a pleasant one.<br />
.Please check out the <a href="mpg123-svn-snapshot.tar.bz2">nightly svn snapshot</a> on your exotic hard- &amp; software and report back to us!

:title Looking for testers
.<p>
.mpg123 runs on a very large number of platforms and supports a wide 
.range of audio output APIs.
.However we the maintainers don't have access to all the systems that are 
.supported by mpg123. We are looking for official testers for various
.platforms to make sure that they still work before we make releases.
.</p>
.<p>
.Take a look at the <a href="testing.shtml">testing</a> page for details.

:title Me got something there: mpg123 version 0.67
.<p>
.Yes, it is time again; the list of changes has grown and a release was overdue.
.Also, the SVN branch that forms a new mpglib (libmpg123) and shapes the mpg123 application around it is lurking in the background, eager to take over the scene.<br />
.It is possible that 0.67 will be the last release of the old codebase, the next one being based on libmpg123.
.</p>
.<p>
.But that is future, what we have now in release 0.67 is this:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>verified that it builds on SGI IRIX 6.5 for MIPS32 and MIPS64</li>
.<li>enable flexible rate for stdout decoding, too</li>
.<li>UTF8 filtering to ASCII finally works thanks to Mika Tiainen, see <a href="/bugs/1745847">bug 1745847</a></li>
.<li>corrected frame offset; -k was off by one</li>
	This means now that -k disagrees with mpg123 0.59r on many files because the old version does play a frame of silence when encountering LAME tag instead of dropping it for audio.
.<li>added --timeout <i>n</i>: Possibility to end playback on a stream that doesn't give data for <i>n</i> seconds.</li>
.<li>added --loop <i>n</i>: for ... well... looping playback of a track; motivation was persistent internet streaming with unreliable connection (together with --timeout)</li>
.<li>build fixes</li>
.<li>use movap instruction in SSE assembly when compiler supports the needed alignment (idea from MPlayer)</li>
.<li>show decoder options in their priority order in --list-cpu/--test-cpu</li>
.<li>added Perl script to benchmark each of mpg123's CPU optimisations</li>
.<li>portability enhancements and cleanups along with testing on SunOS 4.1.2 with gcc-2.7.0</li>
.<li>workaround for ugly flexible rate for MMX/SSE/3DNowExt code:
.  --with-cpu=mmx also includes i586 code as fallback; similar with the others</li>
.</ul>
.<p>So, head over to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704">sf.net</a> or our download page and get the new stuff!</p>
.<p>Thanks go out to Serge Simon and the R.O.M. 106.5 FM Team (<a href="http://www.rom.lu/">http://www.rom.lu/</a>) for their support, both in form of a monetary donation and a bottle of wine from Luxembourg:-)</p>

:title Bigg-o-release version 0.66!
.<p>
.Been some months, big stuff happened.
.This release finally adds the SSE and 3DNowExt optmized decoders as well as combined builds with runtime decoder selection.
.Also, the assembler codes now work on Cygwin and with MinGW32/Msys, the latter being added as supported environment including the resurrected Win32 audio output.
.</p>
.<p>
.Besides bug fixes and additions like named pipe / FIFO support for the generic control interface and more terminal control, the general portability with the new build system has been improved; also with less hardcoded decisions based on operating system type.
.</p>
.<p>
.A perhaps useful hack is also a new build (./configure --with-cpu=generic_float) that produces 32bit float samples on raw or WAV file writing.
.</p>
.<p>
.This is an important release, also it is hopefully the last release with monolithic audio output (plugin system is nearly there).
.The extracted libmpg123 will become reality in the not too distant future, too.
.Well, for now, go and get version 0.66 from the usual places (see <a href="/download.shtml">download</a> page)!
.</p>

:title Opt, opt, opt! ... and some old gear.
.<p>
.In svn, there happened some new backport of MPlayer's mp3lib goodies: SSE and extended 3DNow! Now we are on par with the other fastest mp3 player also on current CPUs;-)
.Connected to the backporting is the first attempt to create an universal x86 binary that contains all the optimizations and enables choice at runtime; "all the optimizations" meaning all x86 floating point targets except i486, that doesn't fit the common scheme (yet).
</p>
.<p>
.Working on the performance front, I finally managed to build up a test box with a 486DX4-100 and put a Slackware 9 install on it. After verifying that mpg321 doesn't get you anywhere there, I built a i486 optimized mpg123 and took it out for a spin to pump some music into the headphones through the legendary AWE32 BigBoard.
.<br />
.It's just fine for 128kbit/s layer 3 stereo, user cpu load being around 66%, and the buffer catches hickups that occur with some high quality vbr (around 200kbit/s), load being more up to 70%.
.Mono playback (which doesn't use special i486 opts) is able to push the load down to around 50%, so indeed a 486DX2-66 or DX50 could be able to achieve something.
.<br />
.Seeing the still not fully used CPU, I also tried how <a href="http://dermixd.de">DerMixD</a> performs with two mpg123 input channels - one being played actively and the other buffered in background for possible crossfading later. It's nearly ok, but stuttering especially while buffering the second track. I suspect that it's not the cpu here but the i/o with the hard disk behind the CMD640 and/or the threading/context switching pushing system load. I'm gonna try how it is with a 2.6 kernel (NPTL) and also what newer compilers say - this slack has gcc-3.2 and gcc-4.1 improved considerably on performance!
.</p>
.<p>
.Oh, and also I extended the terminal control to include volume and RVA control / display as well added verbosity switch key for enabling/disabling messages / progress indication at runtime. You see: We need to tag a version on that and get it out!
.</p>

:title mpg123 version 0.65 - go, get some bugfixes to play more files!
.<p>
.This release parses id3v2.3 (more) correctly and allows CRC bits to vary which fixes some files by old LAMEs and some streams that are cat'ed together.
.Also, attempts to make the build more friendly to non-GCC environments were undertaken.

:title a short live for 0.63 - here is a hot update version 0.64
.<p>
.I got the report on a denial of service (mpg123 stuck in endless loop) possibility with a web server closing the connection prematurely, wiped up a fix for that and that warrants a quick release in my opinion.
.</p>

:title build fix update mpg123-0.63 now available
.<p>
.The 0.63 of mpg123 is now uploaded to sf.net and soon to be found on freshmeat... it mainly ships the one-line build fix that several people reported to be needed for gcc-3.3 .

:title Merry Christmas! -- And here is my present for you: mpg123-0.62
.<p>
.It was time for the next release. It includes some nice enhancements and fixes:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>JUMP command in generic frontend accepts offsets/positions in seconds (JUMP 4s vs. JUMP 4)</li>
.<li>initial support for ICY meta data in SHOUTcast streams</li>
.<li>a bit of fixing with rva code, added rva and general volume control to generic frontend</li>
.<li>accepting more MIME types for http streaming (application/pls and audio/x-mpeg)</li>
.<li>ID3v2 info output taking less space per default - more resembling the old ID3v1 view for short tags, full view with always one line per item via extra --long-tag switch</li>
.<li>generally less verbosity (i.e. noise on console) per default</li>
.<li>ID3v2 now having some kind of support for unicode; trying to print what's latin1-compatible and prevent messing up of terminal with unknown bytes.</li>
.<li>several bug fixes and small improvements</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.You don't find this release on sourceforge yet as I am plainly unable to find the magic door to the new file release system. If anyone knows how to get a new file release out on sf.net, please let me know! I must have grown stupid and blind over night... (of course I blame the changed sf.net interface instead;-)
.<br />
.Well, now go on to the download section and get it!

:title Behold the freshness - mpg123 0.61 is here!
.<p>
.It's time: The next regular release after the first "new" mpg123.
.There are bug fixes along with some improvements in error
.handling and playback as well as enhanced AltiVec code and
.even bits for good old i486.
.<br />
.The build system got some issues ironed out, mpg123 should
.now also build out of the box on cygwin (though not with
.assembler opts).

:title one month off
.<p>Well, the 0.60 version is just a month out there, about 10000 downloads were made (sf.net and here... there could be more weight on sf.net though), the homepage design got some resfreshment from Stefan Graubner (thanks for that first real mpg123 logo!) and </p>
.<div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">mpg123 is among Debian's <em>free</em> software now!</div>
.<p>
.The development didn't stop in the past months and there were bugfixes and enhancements all around.
.Nearly all audio outputs got changes in error handling (allowing restoration of terminal instead of just crashing out on error), thus I hereby kindly ask any interested folks to test if the fresh <a href="http://mpg123.de/download/mpg123-svn-r491.tar.gz">mpg123 svn snapshot</a> breaks anything - we cannot test every audio output since we don't have every platform available...
.</p>
.<p>
.The next release will come.

:title Finally the final release - get mpg123 version 0.60!
.<p>
.It is the night of the 29th August 2006 and the time the new stable mpg123 is slipping through my fingers into the net.<br />
.For those who didn't follow the development, here's the news:
.</p>
.<ul style="margin-left:1cm">
.<li>LGPL license</li>
.<li>compilation via ./configure && make (i.e. GNU autoconf...)</li>
.<li>many bugfixes</li>
.<li>more audio outputs, updated Alsa</li>
.<li>more robust playback</li>
.<li>MMX and AltiVec optimizations</li>
.<li>RVA/ReplayGain</li>
.<li>basic ID3v2</li>
.<li>improved http and playlist operation</li>
.<li>...just see yourself!</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.This version is the result of merging 0.59r by Michael Hipp and parts of his development tree with the 0.59r-gpl from sourceforge and mpg123-thor (both including patchsets from Debian) as well as continued work on the source of both Nicholas and myself as well as enthusiastic testers who gave us a purpose (thanks for being with us after that long time!).
.</p>
.<p>
.Long story short: Head over to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&amp;package_id=148937&amp;release_id=443356">sourceforge</a> and get it!
.</p>
.<p>
.Note for old school fellas: This official end user release only works with the new autoconf make system. The MakeLegacy.sh script for using the old-style Makefile needs a src/config.h.legacy file mimicking settings from the autoconf&acute;ed config.h . You can find an example that works on my linux laptop in the svn tree.

:title no more betas... please! 0.60-beta6 is out

:title 0.60-beta5 - playlist update
.The freshest mpg123 now is the beta5 of the upcoming 0.60 release. It fixes a bug that prevented
.<pre>
.cat list.m3u | mpg123 -@ -
.</pre>
.from working and enhances the playlist code by making the line reading buffer dynamic.
.<br />
.Also, the playlist code is now much cleaner and self-contained in an extra unit (well, what does the user care, eh? ;-).
.<br />
.Hurry up, buggers - we do not really plan to release another beta! 

:date 2006-08-22
:by Thomas
:title 0.60-beta4 is finally there!
.It was about time, we spent so much time coding on this that I now don&acute;t have the time for big words;-)<br />
.Important news include:
.<ul>
.<li>proper seeking, also for VBR streams</li>
.<li>real two-way seeking in remote control mode at all</li>
.<li>better estimates of remaining frames (on vbr files), exact if Xing header is found</li>
.<li>Removed libao support (as it is GPL and we aren't - and we don't need it with native Alsa)</li>
.<li>Added ALSA 0.9/1.0 support by Clemens Ladisch (old alsa is in audio_alsa05.c but will most likely vanish soon)</li>
.<li>Added PortAudio audio-output support</li>
.<li>Added SDL audio-output support</li>
.<li>Fixed NAS audio-output support</li>
.<li>re-enabled MPEG 2.5, code just seems to work</li>
.<li>improved stream checking; being more willing in general (favor resync instead of bail out) but directly give up if free format stream is obvious</li>
.<li>Whee! Initial Relative Volume Adjustment (buzz) support with reading of ReplayGain values in lame/info tag, the RVA2 frames in ID3v2.4, ID3v2 TXXX tags from foobar2000 (please test, someone!) and custom ID3v2.3 comments entitled RVA / RVA_ALBUM / RVA_AUDIOPHILE / RVA_RADIO / RVA_MIX</li>
.<li>more persistence in trying to get http streams</li>
.</ul>
.So, head over to downloads and get it, test it, report on it!

:date 2006-08-13
:by Thomas
:title The next beta still near...
.There is an issue with the new Alsa output to be sorted out. I hope to release the perhaps last beta after having a fix for that.
.If you feel the urge to be on the edge don&acute;t hesitate to check the current svn version and report any issues.

:date 2006-08-13
:by Thomas
:title The next beta is near!
.We are coming more close to something to be called stable; the last important bugfix was loosening an earlier bugfix to fit some files (only those encoded with new lame??). If you have stuttery playback / unsteady speed with some files, try the upcoming beta or a svn snapshot.<br />
.There is a new alsa output by Clemens Ladisch removing the need for libao (which is not LGPL) and the addition of RVA (relative volume adjustment) or ReplayGain support via Lame/Info tag and ID3v2 info - in theory even the ID3 tags that foobar2000 creates.

:title automatic fire - 0.60-beta3 is out!
.Thanks for quickly taking my bold statement about the best mpg123 ever to the test and providing the reports for two bugs that have been fixed.
.<br />
.Also, some enhancements crept in - mainly with http and playlists (where Shoutcast/Winamp PLS can now be parsed directly by mpg123).
.Please head over to sourceforge and find the next bugs to kill on the way to a stable release.
:date 2006-07-25
:by Thomas
:title 0.60-beta2 release!
.Yes! The time has come - the new mpg123 shows its advent with the first public beta release.
.Don't wonder why it is called beta2, just go to the <a href="/download.shtml">download section</a> and get it!
.<br />
.This release is the first official product resulting from the merge of the 0.59r-gpl and 0.59r-thor forks back into <em>the</em> mpg123.
.Though tagged beta, I consider it being the best, most secure mpg123 version available now and encourage everybody to test it.
.<br />
.For sure there are glitches in the new/modified build system and general small issues with platforms that the current developers cannot test.
.Please help them (us) ironing these out before the final version 0.60 .
.<br />
.See the documentation in the source package or on sourceforge.net (release notes, changelog) for details on what&acute;s really new.

.The next release, 0.60, will be based on <a href="http://thomas.orgis.org/mpg123-thor">mpg123-thor</a>, thus sporting the Debian fixes together with enhanced control interface.
.Furthermore, there will be
.<ul>
.<li>a clear license statement, spoken out loud for all distros to hear</li>
.<li>incorporation of the pre-0.59s MMX assembler code</li>
.<li>proper ignoring of "unsynched" ID3V2 data (no choke on embedden raw bitmap anymore...), as does pre-0.59s</li>
.<li>experimental (iow: not perfect but working) gapless playback of mp3 files encoded with Lame</li>
.</ul>
.You can have a glimpse on current development via subversion: `svn co svn://orgis.org/mpg123/trunk mpg123-svn` (will create folder mpg123-svn with current snapshot, but you knew that already;-)
