:title The next beta still near...
.There is an issue with the new Alsa output to be sorted out. I hope to release the perhaps last beta after having a fix for that.
.If you feel the urge to be on the edge don&acute;t hesitate to check the current svn version and report any issues.

:title The next beta is near!
.We are coming more close to something to be called stable; the last important bugfix was loosening an earlier bugfix to fit some files (only those encoded with new lame??). If you have stuttery playback / unsteady speed with some files, try the upcoming beta or a svn snapshot.<br />
.There is a new alsa output by Clemens Ladisch removing the need for libao (which is not LGPL) and the addition of RVA (relative volume adjustment) or ReplayGain support via Lame/Info tag and ID3v2 info - in theory even the ID3 tags that foobar2000 creates.

:title automatic fire - 0.60-beta3 is out!
.Thanks for quickly taking my bold statement about the best mpg123 ever to the test and providing the reports for two bugs that have been fixed.
.<br />
.Also, some enhancements crept in - mainly with http and playlists (where Shoutcast/Winamp PLS can now be parsed directly by mpg123).
.Please head over to sourceforge and find the next bugs to kill on the way to a stable release.

:title 0.60-beta2 release!
.Yes! The time has come - the new mpg123 shows its advent with the first public beta release.
.Don't wonder why it is called beta2, just go to the <a href="/download.shtml">download section</a> and get it!
.<br />
.This release is the first official product resulting from the merge of the 0.59r-gpl and 0.59r-thor forks back into <em>the</em> mpg123.
.Though tagged beta, I consider it being the best, most secure mpg123 version available now and encourage everybody to test it.
.<br />
.For sure there are glitches in the new/modified build system and general small issues with platforms that the current developers cannot test.
.Please help them (us) ironing these out before the final version 0.60 .
.<br />
.See the documentation in the source package or on sourceforge.net (release notes, changelog) for details on what&acute;s really new.

:title A note about Lame
:by Thomas
.During hacking with the gapless mp3 support, I investigated the working of which with different sampling rates.
.I guess I found a Lame bug concering the resampling it can do on request (removing audio at the end).<br>
.The <a href="/lame-resampling.shtml">page about my Lame/resampling tests</a> documents this and as a plus offers some plots showing the gapless mode working nicely.

.Half a year did pass not without serious work going on in the hidden.
.The next release, 0.60, will be based on <a href="http://thomas.orgis.org/mpg123-thor">mpg123-thor</a>, thus sporting the Debian fixes together with enhanced control interface.
.Furthermore, there will be
.<ul>
.<li>a clear license statement, spoken out loud for all distros to hear</li>
.<li>incorporation of the pre-0.59s MMX assembler code</li>
.<li>proper ignoring of "unsynched" ID3V2 data (no choke on embedden raw bitmap anymore...), as does pre-0.59s</li>
.<li>experimental (iow: not perfect but working) gapless playback of mp3 files encoded with Lame</li>
.</ul>
.You can have a glimpse on current development via subversion: `svn co svn://orgis.org/mpg123/trunk mpg123-svn` (will create folder mpg123-svn with current snapshot, but you knew that already;-)

.Yes! The project is <font color="#ff0000" size=+1">not</font> maintained at the moment
.and there are some serious <font color="#ff0000" size=+1">security problems</font> in the latest player versions. It
.is highly recommended to <font color="#ff0000" size=+1">not</font> use the source code you can download from this
.site. Check <a href="http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/non-free/m/mpg123/mpg123_0.59r-18/changelog">Debian Advisory</a>

.FAQ: The license of the mpg123 player is GPL and the license of the mpglib/ inside the mpg123 package is LGPL.

.Important information about the Gobble Exploit: It seems, that only the
.pre0.59s version is vulnerable. The hotfix is to increase the 
.MAX_INPUT_FRAMESIZE to a big value. Ie 4096. I will review the whole code this weekend.
.I will also try to supply an mp3 checker this weekend. So it is not necessary to remove all
.your mp3s. Just do not play them with a potentially vulnerable player and check them later.
.Thanx.

.I changed the license of the 'mpglib' part. It's now under LGPL

.Propably your waiting for the next release, but
.I did not manage to apply all patches from my TODO list yet and
.added a few new bugs that I must hunt down first. Nevertheless, a lot of bugs are fixed in the
.CVS version. Please test it and report remaining bugs you find.

.Just to let you know: I'm still alive and I hope to have some
.spare time in september to add some patches and test the current CVS version to make
.a new minor release.
