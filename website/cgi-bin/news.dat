:title mpg123 version 1.13.2 is here
.<p>
.Maintenance shows itself in the following points:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Updated .NET wrapper (MPG123_SKIP_ID3V2, encsize and mpg123_strlen functions) by Malcolm Boczek.</li>
.<li>Fix crash when calling mpg123_decoder() before opening a track -- a rare use case since one can choose a decoder with mpg123_new() already.</li>
.<li>Fix format change detection for certain (artificial) concatenated streams (p.ex. MPEG 1 frames following MPEG 2 frames).</li>
.<li>Prevent the nasty of bug 3154889: No change of pitch without a current audio format. No proper solution, but more like earlier behaviour.</li>
.<li>Fix some compiler warnings.</li>
.<li>Fix a memory leak in the module loader, also some in the examples, for being pedantic.</li>
.<li>More use of AC_LANG_SOURCE to silence autoconf.</li>
.</ul>

:title mpg123 in the FOSS world
.<p>There are some things going on that I'd like to remind the world and myself on:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>The ffmpeg project could still profit from getting a libmpg123 wrapper: <a href="http://multimedia.cx/eggs/gcc-of-multimedia/">ffmpeg audio decoder performance comparison</a>. Now a question is: Which fork of ffmpeg? I remember Michael saying that he won't oppose a wrapper when it's maintained, while Diego stronly argued for actually moving mpg123 code into ffmpeg and ditch any separate specialized library.</li>
.<li>GStreamer apps could also profit from getting libmpg123 mojo -- and there is <a href="http://gst.homeunix.net/">a libmpg123 plugin for GStreamer</a>, which apparently just needs some polish. See discussion at <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=558235">GNOME / Rhythmbox</a> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/rhythmbox/+bug/290150">launchpad bug for Rhythmbox</a></li>
.</ul>
.<p>Indeed, after getting some mpg123 into XMMS2 and MPlayer (try -ac mpg123 on a recent build) ... ffmpeg and GStreamer are two influential multimedia frameworks that we also should be part of.</p>

:title mpg123 1.13.1
.<p>New Year, new bugs (from last year) -- and their fixes!</p>
.<p>This release fixes a stupid regression in 1.13.0 that broke MPG123_FORCE_FLOAT and MPG123_FORCE_8BIT (--float and --8bit command line switches), caused by the introduction of 24 bit format support.
.Furthermore, it has been suggested to ignore the private / extension header bit in the parser's stream checking and so it is now.</p>

:title mpg123 1.13.0
.<p>Just as the 12th day of the 12th month of this year gives way to the 13th, the mpg123 1.12 series gives way to the mpg123 1.13 series. And this we got for you:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 API version 29 (mpg123_encsize(), MPG123_SKIP_ID3V2, mpg123_strlen(), 24 bit output, ARM decoder)</li>
.<li>New optimization: <strong>ARM NEON (Cortex A series)</strong> -- kudos to Taihei, again!</li>
.<li>Added 24 bit integer output (truncation of 32 bit integer)</li>
.<li>Cleanup of symbols for the static library: Only have global symbols that are actually needed, prefix them with INT123_ to avoid conflicts.</li>
.<li>Added --streamdump to get a copy of the data libmpg123 used.</li>
.<li>Added --icy-interval and tweaked libmpg123 to make playback of ICY stream dumps possible.</li>
.<li>Added possibility to set module file suffix at build -- to be able to avoid .la files for plugins.</li>
.<li>Removed compiler directives for alignment and disable associated tests.<br />
.  The tests don't work on a wide range of compilers anyway, and newer gccs
.  do have force_align_arg_pointer to fix bad stacks.</li>
.<li>There is no ChangeLog file anymore... it was autogenerated from subversion log anyway, so look there if interested.</li>
.</ul>
.Have fun with that ... unless hordes of bugs come screaming at us, consider this this year's christmas (or winter solstice, if you please) present from the mpg123 team;-)

:title Server move.
.<p>
.The mpg123 website and source code repository server has moved!<br />
.Ideally, nobody did notice except for the notices. But there is one change for the future: I'd like people to use svn://svn.orgis.org/mpg123 as URL for the source code repository. The added subdomain adds flexibility that one might need for future server moves.
.Anyway, business as usual... go along, nothing special to see. Well, and stay tuned for the upcoming release featuring new assembly optimizations for modern ARM machines.

:title Fixing your world with mpg123-1.12.2
.<p>The fresh maintenance release mainly fixes bug <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2996045&amp;group_id=135704&amp;atid=733194">2996045</a>, invalid memory access prompted by addresses in the upper half of the address space. I introduced that one with a bad alignment algorithm, sorry.<p>
.<p>Along with this go several other fixes/improvements:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Various build and portability fixes (including making some exotic configure switches work (again)).</li>
.<li>Add dump_seekindex example</li>
.<li>Sync mpg123_clr (.NET wrapper) to 1.12 feature set, patch provided by Malcolm Boczek -- and actually include it in release tarball!</li>
.<li>Rework mpg123.h logic for large file stuff a bit, clients can control it by defining MPG123_NO_LARGENAME or MPG123_LARGESUFFIX.</li>
.<li>Include dumb wrappers to provide names suffixed with _64 on 64 bit machines and _32 on 32 bit machines, respectively, to help clients that insist on defining _FILE_OFFSET_BITS where it is not needed (or with a non-large value).</li>
.<li>Tuning of the internal buffer code for feeder mode to minimize its performance impact (works in 4K blocks now).</li>
.<li>Workaround for compiler bugs in Open64/PathScale/SunStudio (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=3004396&amp;group_id=135704&amp;atid=733194">bug 3004396</a>, suggestion by Doug Gilmore). <br />
.  Note that Sun Studio is still a tricky fellow, at least when it comes to our preprocessed assembly (generic build works).
.  Also, x86-Open64 recently produced another segfault in layer3.c on my box... GNU and intel compilers are what one can use as something stable.</li>
.<li>Make mpg123_getformat() return more error codes (like MPG123_NEED_MORE).</li>
.<li>Fix handle I/O for clients with small file offset (32 bit when libmpg123 has 64 bit).</li>
.<li>Fix 3DNow(Ext) standalone builds.</li>

:title Got a new toy... and wired it up to mpg123!
.<p>I uploaded a quick hack that turns two instances of mpg123 and a MIDI controller (in this case the rather inexpensive M-Audio XSession pro) into a simple live DJ set: See the <a href="download/mpg123-midi-control.c">source code of mpg123-midi-control</a>.
.I'll cut out the guts of the comment header to make this little post complete:</p>
.<p>
.        This is a hacky proof of concept for getting my M-Audio XSession pro to excert some effect on mpg123, on Linux systems with ALSA sequencer API.
.
.        The idea is to run two instances of mpg123 like that:
.</p>
.<pre>mpg123 -R --fifo /dev/shm/mpg123-1
.mpg123 -R --fifo /dev/shm/mpg123-2
.</pre>
.<p>
.        Then run this program here with a playlist (listing of absolute file paths) from STDIN
.</p>
.<pre>cat absolute-playlist | ./mpg123-control /dev/shm/mpg123-1 /dev/shm/mpg123-2
.</pre>
.<p>
.        and connect it to the MIDI controller (adjust port numbers):
.</p>
.<pre>aconnect 20:0 129:0</pre>
.<p>
.        With that setup, you will load tracks from the playlist with the eject buttons for the respective channel, start/stop playback with the play/pause buttons... the volume and pitch faders will do something you might expect... the EQ buttons change the EQ settings.
.        In short: You have a nifty basic DJ setup on your PC with two plain instances of mpg123.
.</p><p>
.        Note that the pitching only works in a range the hardware or your audio output support (i.e. ALSA dmix)... and you need to be able to open two audio outputs at once, at different rates (ALSA dmix can do that... but it rather stresses the CPU -- though on modern machines you might not notice).
.        Anyhow, it is just a fun proof-of-concept to be able to get some reaction out of my MIDI toy.
.</p>
.<p>It works rather well... of course the pitching is not optimal, since mpg123 re-opens the audio output for every pitch change, but the volume/fader and EQ controls work nicely. If you're into this stuff, you should now have a simple example to adapt to your gear
.(different MIDI controllers might just need changes to the numerical constants naming the controllers and buttons).</p>

:title A large déjà vu: mpg123 1.12.0 fixes the future for large file support, again.
.<p>Please forget the previous release, 1.11.0 . The libmpg123_64.so it introduced on largefile-sensitive systems is gone now. The interfaces for applications using system default file offsets and those using enabled large file support are unified in one libmpg123.so now.
.Version 1.12.0 of mpg123 shall mark the first stable ABI for such systems since mpg123 1.4.x, after which libmpg123.so usually offered only the interface for large files. Please, please: Update to this one so that emerging users of libmpg123 do not get bitten by an inconsistent base of mpg123 installations with incompatible libraries.</p>
.<p>As a side effect of dual mode hacking, replacement I/O using client-provided handles (void pointer) has been added to the API. Oh, and the introduction of AI_ADDRCONFIG has been made conditional based on the actual availability of that flag on a system (that helps OpenBSD).</p>
.<p><a href="download.shtml">Download mpg123</a> version 1.12.0 now!</p>
.<p><strong>Update:</strong>In 1.12.0, there was still a passage in INSTALL referring to the twin libraries, I changed that and released 1.12.1 -- there are no changes in the code.</p>

:title Another round in the war with large files: Please test the all-fresh mpg123 snapshot with dual-mode large file support.
.<p>Dear people interested in the magnificent mpg123,</p>
.<p>since the 1.11.0 release brougt the combined confused anger of the world directed against me for my simple and clean (for the maintainer) approach to ABI stability, the "twinlibs" libmpg123.so and libmpg123_64.so, I spent another couple of days/nights on fixing the mess that is large file support on Linux/Solaris.</p>
.<p>Under <a href=snapshot>http://mpg123.org/snapshot</a> , you now find a preview on what may become mpg123 1.12.0, featuring dual-mode libmpg123. I really tried to keep all the funny and complicated aspects of the API working with a 32bit-offset app using a libmpg123 with large file support. The bold and fearless are invited to look at <a href="http://mpg123.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/src/libmpg123/lfs_wrap.c?view=markup">my approach at a dual-mode layer</a>, this file is the main part of that.<br />
.Everyone is invited, humbly requested, barely expected to check out the snapshot tarball to build mpg123 plus library and verify that the dual-large-file mode really works.</p>
.<p>My regression tests look good, I also created a >2G mp3 file and verified that I can play it as stream with a small-file mpg123 binary using a large-file-enabled libmpg123, but API calls hitting the limit of 32 bit file offsets fail as expected, in a controlled manner.</p>
.<p>I do want to do it right this time, so please give me (ideally, mpg123-devel or mpg123-users mailing list) feedback and opinions about this upcoming release of mpg123!</p>

:title What a fuss. Large files suck, don't they?
.<p>
.Reactions to my split of small and large file libmpg123 are mostly irritated, confused ... or even hostile. Too sad that mpg123 does not have enough outreach to have people complaining about the test release two weeks ago, before I made it official.
.Now there are facts and the world does not like them. I am in discussion with someone knowing that largefile business and perhaps he can help me to come to a conclusion. Maybe I'll do dual mode in the end, supporting 32 and 64 bit offsets from one library. So stay tuned... something will happen in the next days. I don't promise what, though.
.</p>
.<p>
.To mirror the anger and frustration I met out there, I want to express my anger and frustration about the whole 64on32 large file mess. I hate it. I hate it that I fell into the trap of making the mpg123 API rely on shape-shifting off_t (but at the same time feel that it is still correct, by concept -- would off_t be a stable entity). I'll try to find a solution nevertheless. But I hate it. Free software is not always fun. Not at all.

:title mpg123 1.11.0 by large -- re-issued
.<p>
.<strong>Attention:</strong> The initial source package was missing the crucial changes for the library name.
.I uploaded a corrected version around 2010-03-21 22:30 CET. Please get a fresh one if you got your download earlier than that.
.</p>
.<p>
.So, here it is: The mpg123 release that hopefully causes only small trouble now, but will be safe for the future regarding the mess that is the hybrid setup of small and large file support on certain systems (like GNU/Linux and Solaris on x86). If your system does optional large file support, a build of libmpg123 with that enabled will be called libmpg123_64.so, a default build with small file support will be called just libmpg123.so like before.<br />
.Note that default means that what you get when not giving special flags or preprocessor defines -- the configure script will detect the optional large file support and enable it by default, thus, changing from the system default. Confused? Right.
.</p>
.<p>
.But there are some goodies without side effect, too:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Support for HTTP streams in Windows builds of mpg123.</li>
.<li>More foolproof IPv6 behaviour (not asking for IPv6 connections when there are no suitable interfaces).</li>
.<li>Fix a potential reading problem with ICY streams.</li>
.<li>Assembler cleanup that will enable optimized builds with the Sun compiler once it got a certain bug fixed.</li>
.</ul>
.<p>So, get the new <a href="download/mpg123-1.11.0.tar.bz2">mpg123-1.11.0 source</a> and be happy (possibly after relinking some apps).</p>

:date 2010-03-10
:by Thomas
:title Working on a stable future for large file support (again).
.<p>The optional large file support on Linux/Solaris still troubles the mpg123 project. Of course the troubles started with me unwittingly choosing to expose off_t in the API.
.From mpg123-1.5.0 on up to the recently released 1.10.1, I at least opted to prevent runtime damage by renaming API functions according to the selection in large file support.
.This, again, is not a good idea when leaving the library name unchanged: A new build with large file support actually exposes a different ABI and thus is not compatible with an old binary.</p>
.<p>So, here is my second attempt on getting the situation predictable: Not just some symbols, the whole library gets renamed when large file support is enabled. You get libmpg123_64 instead of libmpg123.
.That means a one-time incompatible switch for any binary that depends on a libmpg123 with 64 bit file offsets (on the affected systems),
.but it preserves compatibility for older and future binaries that depend on &quot;default&quot; file offset size (that is, 32 bit on a 32 bit Linux system). It hurts once, but after the switch, we have, if not a pretty, but at least predictable vision of the future.</p>
.<p>If nobody comes up with a better idea (no, supporting 32 bit and 64 bit offsets in one build is not considered better... it's not worth the maintenance work and is error-prone, in my view), the next release of mpg123 will bring the change of library name depending on enabled large file support.</p>
.<p><strong>So please test it and be prepared, perhaps give some comments about it:</strong> <a href="download/mpg123-1.11.0-dev_largefile.tar.bz2">mpg123-1.11.0 preview for the large file name change</a></p>
.<p>To all users of systems that are not sensitive to variable off_t size (most non-Linux/Solaris, 64 bit systems): Be happy and do not worry about this mess. For anyone who wants to worry and understand the issue, have a read of <a href="http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/largefile/">Guido Draheim's work on the matter</a>.</p>
.<p><strong>And, not to forget, there are other goodies with mpg123-1.11.0:</strong> Also concerning portability and ABI stability, the SSE code does not rely on aligned variables on the stack anymore.
.At least that is the idea behind doing all explicit alignments now on the heap with pointer arithmetic -- as a side effect, I have seen speedup from that change, too.<br />
.Then, we got enhancements of the networking code, enabling network streams for plain Windows builds (MinGW) and fixing sub-optimal behaviour with respect to IPv6 (not asking for IPv6 name resolution unless there are IPv6 interfaces configured).</p>

:title mpg123 1.10.1 - the most wanted maintenance release
.<p>GNU/Linux distributions that employ multilib will really want to upgrade to this one because, after elaborate debates on various bug trackers (<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20042">wine</a> and <a href=" http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=299490">gentoo</a>, at least), I finally disarmed the largefile consistency check in the mpg123 header. It was not compatible with multilib setups that failed to provide a separate header for 32 bit (with explicitly enabled large file support) and 64 bit (large file support implicit).</p>
.<p>Of course, that is not all. More to the core of mpg123, there are important bug fixes for gapless decoding and the feeder mode of the library (reliable  handling of garbage and (apparent) free format streams). The full list of goodies:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Help multilib setups that boldly assume that headers are invariant by removing the consistency check in mpg123.h and instead just adding a suffix to relevant functions when _FILE_OFFSET_BITS is defined. Invalid setups will now fail at the linking stage instead of the preprocessing stage.
.  That should cover <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2934488&group_id=135704&atid=733194">bug 2934488</a>.</li>
.<li>Fixes for gapless decoding:
.<ul>
.  <li>Correctly skip padding larger than one MPEG frame (strange, but occurs).</li>
.  <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2950218&group_id=135704&atid=733194">Bug 2950218</a> (proper gapless cuts for seeking near the end).</li>
.</ul></li>
.<li>Make sure the search for the first header aborts after 64K of one-byte reads, as always intended (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2951334&group_id=135704&atid=733194">bug 2951334</a>).<br />
.  Certain files (or even random data) were able to fool mpg123 sufficiently enough that it basically reads through the whole file in 1-byte steps in search for MPEG data.
.  The limit of 64K will very likely be configurable in a future mpg123 version.</li>
.<li>Fix subtle bug with seeking in feeder mode: A seek close to the current position (meaning: the needed data offset is already in mpg123's buffer chain) resulted in skipped bytes.</li>
.<li>Improve the feeder mode for handling large amounts of junk at the beginning, including proper passing of the request for more data when trying to determine free format frame size. This also fixes endless looping as reported in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2951334&group_id=135704&atid=733194">bug 2951334</a>.</li>
.<li>The parser code still needs overhaul. It is not pretty.</li>
.<li>Compile fix for OpenAL (with strict compiler).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>You see, this upgrade is a no-brainer. I gets a number of bugs out of the way to add more fun stuff to the next release, 1.11.0 . Get it from the <a href="download.shtml">usual places</a>.</p>
.<p>Update: I fixed the link to <a href="/current">current mpg123</a> to actually point to the current version. Oh, and, I must admit that indeed, mpg123 is to blame for an oversight regarding IPv6 support which can trouble you with your broken DNS server (DSL router):
.It asks for IPv6 name resolution even if your setup does not feature IPv6 interfaces... together with glibc 2.10, that is rather annoying (see the web for stories). A future release will fix that, but lacking time for that, I point to the svn trunk, which has it fixed, or this little patch that should apply to a reasonable number of past releases:</p>

:title version 1.10.1 pre-release number 3
.<p>The upcoming bugfix release is quite a prominent one, being focus of frantic attention mainly because of the trouble multilib systems have with the old large-file safety hack in the header.
.That safety hack is largely gone now -- with the header resulting in being identical for 32 bit and 64 bit mode on a multilib system.</p>
.<p>But there is more to it: There are important fixes for gapless decoding corner cases and improvements of the parser for bad files: prevent seemingly endless loop in search of first valid header and more so seemingly (at least) endless loop for the feeder mode.</p>
.<p>Get the <a href="download/mpg123-1.10.1-prerelease3.tar.bz2">pre-release source code</a>, or the occasional binary from the <a href="download/win64">win64 directory</a>, if you are so inclined. And yes, This could just be named 1.10.1-rc3 to be consistent with earlier practice, but I did not know at the first pre-release that it would become that official. Sorry, really. Now get up and test it so that we can do the release for good;-)</p>

:title The mpg123 version 1.10.0 is there!
.<p>Here's a list of the features and fixes in this release:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Confirmed/fixed on OS/2 platform.
.  At least a static build works with native audio output and generic decoder.</li>
.<li>Make modules work with libtool-2.2.6b .</li>
.<li>Added pitch command to control interface.</li>
.<li>HTTP header field and MIME type parsing now case-insensitive (fixes bug 2904736).
.  Also, the MIME-parsing for non-playlist URLs is done the same way as from playlists now.
.  And, we interpret MIME types only to before a ";" (see bug 2836904).</li>
.<li>There is a build-time option to enable unicode file names on windows now. UNIX (Linux) does not need that, UTF-8 works natively.
.  An unicode-enabled build of libmpg123 expects file names as UTF-8 strings, opening of non-utf8 strings (by old applications) still works via fallback when the conversion of the string or opening of the file failed.</li>
.<li>Also, on Windows, --realtime now works, along with added granularity of the new --priority parameter. Note that you get the latter functionality through nice/renice on UNIX, no need to add that to mpg123.</li>
.<li>Added experimental framebyframe API.</li>
.<li>Added a new Microsoft common language runtime wrapper (aka .NET wrapper) written by Malcolm Boczek. See ports\MSVC++\2008clr\mpg123clr\ReadMe.txt for further information</li>
.<li>Added Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 project files for libmpg123</li>
.<li>Updated autotools machinery, autogen.sh is gone, use `autoreconf -iv`.</li>
.</ul>

:title Another bugfix release. We care about bugs. We wanna squash them!
.<p>The simple facts:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Fix logic failure in gapless code: The trailing silence was only cut on the first decode. So, seek-back and decode again never was gapless:-(</li>
.<li>Fix linker flags on MacOS 10.6 .</li>
.<li>Improve portability (mainly for Solaris/x86, possibly others).</li>
.<li>Fix reading from standard input in Windows (use binary mode).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>So just <a href="download.shtml">download mpg123 1.9.2</a>!</p>

:title A basket of bugfixes in 1.9.1 .
.<p>Some bugs and regression fixes accumulated quickly in the lively mpg123 svn repository... so here is the mandatory update for 1.9.0:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Fix OpenAL output issue (bug 2840085)</li>
.<li>Fix theoretically possible discarding of some audio samples when getting a new format.</li>
.<li>Fix unwanted verboseness (some error messages from library even when MPG123_QUIET was specified).</li>
.<li>Fix back-to-beginning for feed_skip (fixes bug 2859531).</li>
.<li>Fix the CPU creep bug with NtoM decoding.<br /<
.That one has been nasty on you with large files since bad frame fillup has been introduced.</li>
.<li>Fix regression (since 1.9.0) in ID3 parsing: Now Foobar2000 RVA fields are interpreted again (among others).</li>
.<li>Fix some compiler warnings, minor cleanup.</li>
.</ul>

:title Added hacking guidelines to the website.
.<p>Have a look at the new <a href="/hacking.shtml">page about hacking mpg123</a>, where I collected some rules the mpg123 code follows.

:title mpg123-1.9.0 is ... wait for it ... HERE!
.<p>Another release broadening mpg123's functionality: Free format support and ARM assembly optimizations!<br /> 
.Dither noise is now runtime-generated (so less bloated binary with dithered decoders, thus those are included by default now). Several bugs have been fixed, relating to UTF16 in ID3v2 tags and bad frame fillup for 8 bit samples. Generally the ID3v2 parser is more flexible now with encodings, libmpg123 also offering a switch to defer the transcoding to UTF8 (so that a client application can handle strange encodings in disguise).</p>
.<p>Well, you know where to get it, right? And I know you want it... yeah... give it to yourself...</p>

:title No standstill: mpg123 1.8.1
.<p>The update mainly adds the proper integer / fixed point decoding that accidentally has been promised in the 1.8.0 at places (more still planned for 1.9.0). Minor bug and build system fixes complete the treat, for example updated build files for the Sony PSP.</p>

:title mpg123 1.8.0 -- Yay!
.<p>This one is massive. We got so many improvements... most important: mpg123 is now more correct than ever and it's faster than ever -- especially on modern x86-64 hardware, where we regain the performance crown from the 64bit SSE code in MPlayer (in the mpg123-derived mp3lib, to be specific;-)!</p> 
.<p>Well, no need to blabber about it here, just get your 1.8.0 fix from the usual download locations and enjoy! There is massive text in the <a href="http://mpg123.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/tags/1.8.0/NEWS?view=markup">NEWS</a> file. Have a seat, have a read.<br>
.Thanks go out to the whole team to make this happen, we got strong new contributions this time! Also, thanks to the Hydrogenaudio community for nit-picking at the leftover SB21 cutoff and those least significant bits -- see the colorful <a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=71797">thread on the Hydrogenaudio forum</a>.</p>

.<p>A handful of issues has been resolved with the rc2, cumulating in the next canditate for public review before full-blown release of 1.8.0 (and the inevitable odd bug creeping up and prompting 1.8.1). We should be quite near a release here, one outstanding issue being workability of the x86-64 code on the MS Windows platform (it's fine on GNU/Linux, though) -- debuggers welcome.</p>

:title More goodness for upcoming 1.8.0
.<p>The release is still delayed, but just because it is becoming a better one, indeed! Apart from fixing regressions that hit layer 1 and layer 2 decoding since the 1.x series, there are improvements underway for 16bit accuracy as well. You may have noticed the MPEG compliance log included on the front page. That one is periodically created from the svn snapshot and for 1.8.0 it will indicate full ISO conformity also for 16bits output, where the mpg123 engine has been lacking in the LSB because of rounding (or lack of) in the generic decoder. Note that the i586 decoder already is correct in the LSB, it uses proper rounding in assembler.</p>

:date 2009-04-27
:by Thomas
:title Regression fix: mpg123-1.7.3
.<p>While we eagerly anticipate the 1.8.0 release, there arose the need for a quick regression fix for 1.7.x . The re-introduction of workable --doublespeed introduced a fine regression wich basically made seeking unbearable. Why didn't anyone notice? Seems like people using mpg123 want to hear every microsecond of their music and never hit fast-forward...</p>
.<p>
.So, head over to the download are to get it... and please someone tell me early when I screw up next time:-(
.</p>

:title Security fix: mpg123-1.7.2
.<p>Even since before the 1.x versions, there has been a vulnerability in the ID3v2 code which at least can cause denial of service (i.e. crashes...). Update to the current release -- there is no excuse!</p>

:date 2009-04-03
:by Thomas
:title Regression fix: mpg123-1.7.1
.<p>The interactive adjustment of the RVA setting resulted in utter silence due to a change on mpg123_volume() behaviour. Now, to activate the RVA change, mpg123_volume_change() is used, which works properly.</p>

:title The mpg123-1.7.0 is out with lots of eclecticity and dynamicalinesshood!
.<p>This started around christmas... me reworking the decoder core to play more with the dynamic possibilities of juggling with function pointers at runtime. And hardcore templates in C (you know, it's some sort of preprocessing all along...). There's more runtime choice than ever... and also more build-time choice. Plus: --doublespeed works again!</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Lots of output format fun!
.  <ul>
.  <li>now supporting 8, 16, 32 bit signed/unsigned integers,
.    32bit float (64bit float can be hacked in quickly)</li>
.  <li>optimized decoders use fallback routines for non-optimized
.    formats transparently</li>
.  <li>flexible resampling is automatically chosen when output does
.    not support standard rates (like a JACK server)</li>
.  <li>That meant quite some restructuring in the decoder code...</li>

.  </ul>
.<li>--preload (tune prefill before playback for buffered mode)</li>
.<li>win64 support (one report at least;-), modules working on Windows</li>
.<li>Windows/MSVC++: fixed handling of unicode file names,

:title Bugfixes for flexible resampling with mpg123-1.6.4
.<p>
.This release fixes an issue with flexible resampling and the bad frame fill up introduced in the 1.6 series.
.Also, resampled output should now be consistent across seeks. Get it from the usual places...

:title Large File Fuss
.<p>
.I feel the need remind the world about the messy issue of large file support (sometimes called largefile support instead;-).
.There are certain systems (notably GNU/Linux and Solaris) that have chosen to make that a decision at build time with the type off_t sometimes being 32bit, sometimes 64bit.
.You can compile apps with or without large file support.
.</p>
.<p>
.That means that you can have libraries for 64bit file offsets on your system and libraries for 32bit offsets.
.You can have applications (trying to) using libraries with a different file offset setting.
.That means one thing: Trouble!
.To prevent weird runtime errors or even crashes, I added some precautions to libmpg123, notably at build time, you could see such a message:
.</p>
.<pre>
./usr/include/mpg123.h:37:2: error: #error "Mismatch in large file setup!
  Enable/disable large file support appropriately to use libmpg123."
.</pre>
.<p>
.Also, at runtime, a 64bit offset libmpg123 will fail with a program that is not aware of this -- yielding unresolved symbols due to renaming the affected functions with a suffix indicating 64bits.
.</p>
.<p>
.If you encounter this, please read up and think about that problem, and possibly complain to your OS distribution or the software project whose code is failing. Especially GNU/Linux distributions should be interested in making sure that they don't mix largefile builds with non-largefile code.
.</p>
.<p><strong>Update:</strong> See the <a href="/faq.shtml#lfs">FAQ</a>.</p>

:title New Chapter of the Neverending but Unnerving Tale of 1.6.0
.<p>Let's face it: This week is tight for me. Possibly too tight to make a release.</p>
.<p>Besides all that real life work stuff, there's demanding involvement in organizing and taking part in the fith Brandenburger Linux-Infotag in Potsdam, Germany (BLIT), on 1st November. Perhaps around (or shortly after...) that would be a good time to clean up the docs and push the beast out after all. May be a good idea to settle the ongoing streamlining of the Windows builds during the week, too.</p>
.<p>Oh, and, eh... did I mention the BLIT? If you happen to be not that far from the state of Brandenburg (you know, Berlin's at the center of it;-)... you might want to pay the BLIT a visit; see the <a href="http://blit.org">BLIT-Website</a> for details!</p>

.I intend to release 1.6.0 around this weekend...</p>
.<p>A nice number of improvements accumulated:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>small things inside that I forgot to mention</li>
.<li>some new commands for remote control interface:
.  <ul>
.  <li>SCAN</li>
.  <li>SAMPLE</li>
.  <li>EQFILE</li>
.  <li>SHOWEQ</li>
.  </ul>
.</li>
.<li>added --keep-open command line flag (for remote control)</li>
.<li>fixed equalizer file parsing to really handle comment lines as example file suggests</li>
.<li>more elaborate detection of UTF-8 locale, also --utf8 switch to force it</li>
.<li>libmpg123 9.0.9:
.  <ul>
.  <li>added mpg123_geteq() and mpg123_tell_stream()</li>
.  <li>API cleanup (take const char* for mpg123_open())</li>
.  <li>calm down complainling (C++) compilers by completing the mpg123_channels enum</li>
.  <li>fixed several possible crashes when user provides NULLs where it isn't appropriate</li>
.  <li>workaround for frames that fail decoding (bad frame body, missing bit reservoir): fill up with silence</li>
.    That also fixes seeking issues related to bad frames since now the fixed relation between frame and sample offsets is restored.
.  <li>Finally realized what that the resampling code for integer math (generic_nofpu) was just incomplete!
.    Now it works, using the defined integer multiplication.</li>
.  <li>Detect UTF-8 in ICY conversion (instead of just assuming CP-1252, provided by Torsten Glaser).</li>
.  <li>Prevent ugly noise when the bit reservoir is not fully there (p.ex. ignorantly cut mp3 files).
.    Concerned frames are silenced, but reservoir for following frames is kept.
.    Thanks to Patrick Dehne for the investigation and patch!</li>
.  </ul>
.</li>
.<li>new project files to build/use libmpg123 with MSVC++ 2005 and 2008, provided by Patrick Dehne</li>
.<li>fixed a regression that made the pause/loop mode in terminal control slowly go backwards</li>
.</ul>

:title I-Pee, I-Pee!
.<p>The world shatters as version 1.5.0 of mpg123 is being released - now supporting IPv6 officially (a fresh implementation, after that other patch floating around for years...)!</p>
.<p>But that is not the only change we got there... various features/fixes on different scales went into this one:</p>
.<ul>
.<li> libmpg123 6.0.6
.<ul>
.  <li>Floating point decoding back again, (build time choice for now; --with-cpu=generic_float).</li>
.  <li>More robust string handling; extended string API.</li>
.  <li>fixed an (so far) unnoticed ID3 bug that may have obscured comment fields</li>
.  <li>added mpg123_feed() as shortcut; using const input buffer now</li>
.  <li>resync is enabled again for ICY streams (the trouble in the past was due to a reader bug, not the streams)</li>
.  <li>decode ICY text data to UTF-8 (thanks, Thorsten)</li>
.  <li>preserve file flags for timeout mode</li>
.</li></ul>
.<li> More elaborate (helpful?) error message for output format problems.</li>
.<li> Reworked HTTP code... and added IPv6 support!</li>
.<li> Fix the --proxy parameter (has been accidentally ignored before).</li>
.<li> Added --ignore-mime to work with web streams with funny playlist MIME types like "audio/megurl".</li>
.<li> Know MIME audio/mpegurl.</li>
.<li> --timeout is now also used for the connection itself (not just reading).</li>

.<p>There are two important announcements to bring to you, favoured public:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>mpg123 1.x is in debian lenny (testing)! That means the next stable debian version will have a current mpg123 with libmpg123 as shared lib. That is <em>good</em>:-)</li>
.<li>I finally came around and reworked the http code to be able to update the stuff to support IPv6 (like some patch already did quite some time ago).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.The latter especially means that I need people to test the heck out of the current <a href="/snapshot">development snapshot</a> to find all the nice little bugs I introduced.

.<ul>
.<li>Fix mpg123_tell() and mpg123_seek() return values with respect to the samples in decoding buffer (bug 1947373).</li>
.<li>Fix (bogus) 3DNow detection on IDT C6 (bug 1947982).</li>
.<li>Fix mono playback of win32 output (bug 1955157).</li>
.<li>Fix ABI compatibility with compilers that don't align the stack like gcc does (fixing SSE crashes on win32).</li>
.</ul>

.<p>The new release is there, adding essentially one convenience feature and one serious bug fix, here's the list:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Enable runtime check for available and working output modules.<br />
.  Now mpg123 tries all built modules (or a list specified in mpg123 -o moda,modb,modc) in turn to find a working output.
.  This minimizes the situation of having to specify a device when default output doesn't work for some reason.
.  See bug 1910500.</li>
.<li>libmpg123 2.2.2
.  <ul>
.  <li>Fixing an endless loop for ICY streams that suddenly end without error (just EOF).</li>
.  <li>Further fixes around EOF handling in (buffered/ICY) streams.</li>
.  </ul></li>
.<li>Enable user to interrupt mpg123 when stuck in a loop of failing to open a track (with --loop).</li>
.<li>This time with correct RPM spec (hopefully... sorry, Michael!).</li>

.<p>In less words: Get it!</p>

:title Bugfix release mpg123-1.2.1 .
.<div>
.A little taste of routine... treating some issues with this release:
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 libtool-version 1.2.1 (coincidence!)
.	<ul>
.		<li>Earlier check for free format headers to prevent them from screwing up resync (free format still not supported).</li>
.		<li>Bug 1889051: more flexible resync, not insisting on the format of the first frame (which could have been bogus).</li>
.	</ul></li>
.	<li>Add an output write loop to handle SIGSTOP/CONT operation (bug 1890563).</li>
.	<li>Fixed a bug where playback status for some http streams was not shown.</li>
.</ul>
.You know where to get it, right? ;-)

:title Updating again: mpg123-1.2.0!
.<p>And here is the next incremental update, fixing some bugs, mainly in the build system, and adding the resync limit parameter to libmpg123 and the mpg123 app. There is convenience for RPM Linux distro users: You can run rpmbuild -tb on the mpg123 release tarball and get a qick-and-dirty rpm for installation though the included spec file.</p>
.<p>An embarrassing omission has been fixed, too: The i486 decoder files now actually are included in the distribution!</p>
.<p>
.So, head over to Sourceforge and get the stuff.
.</p>
.<p>
.Also in the news... we have mpg123 on the PSP with <a href="http://pspupdates.qj.net/MODO-January-30-update-added-MP3-support-via-libmpg123/pg/49/aid/112710">MODO</a>!

.<li>Added arts output.</li>
.<li>More verbosity on lame/xing/info tags (on demand) instead of compile-time debugging switch.</li>
.<li>XMMS2 plugin cleanup (submitted to XMMS2 for inclusion)</li>
.<li>Improved ID3v2 robustness (let bad tags not affect playback of the important part).</li>
.<li>Terminal control:</li>
.<ul>
.<li>Key for going to previous track ([d], because it's left of [f] usually... no config file yet for that).</li>
.<li>Key for printing current playlist, [l].</li>
.<li>Now possible to switch on verbosity also for mpg123 -q -C</li>
.<li>Key for (re)printing ID3 tag info ([t]).</li>
.<li>Key for (re)printing MPEG frame header info ([m]).</li>
.</ul>
.<li>Soften the -q option: Now you are able to increase verbosity after -q again, like mpg123 -q -v (this fixes cplay's progress display).</li>

:title Happy new mpg123! Version 1.0.0 is out!
.<p>
.Some fixes went into the 1.0rc3 during the week, but the substance is unchanged.
.It is time to release the stable version 1.0.0!
.Get the tarball from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&package_id=148937&release_id=563661"> Sourceforge</a> or the local <a href="download.shtml">download page</a> and enjoy.
.</p>
.<p>
.This is, finally, the first "complete" stable release of the revived mpg123 project.
.The 0.6x series already added a GNU autotool'ed build system and runtime cpu optimization selection, together with numerous bug fixes .and an enhanced generic control interface.
.</p><p>
.Now a big step has been taken, adding a re-born decoder library to replace the old mpglib (libmpg123) and support for run-time audio .output selection, which was one usability advantage mpg321 had over mpg123.
.Nearly every part of the mpg123 source has seen some restructuring or cleanup.
.</p>
.<p>
.The development from 0.6x to 1.0.0 also saw several smaller feature additions - make sure you check mpg123 --longhelp for anything you do not know already;-).

.</p>
.<p>
.Quite a few fixes and improvements went into the second release candidate.
.ID3 handling is safer now and IDv2 support has been added to the remote control interface.
.The buffer and general output code got much attention, so that, among others, the buffer now works properly on MacOSX, write errors to .output are handled now and the interactive experience with the buffer and terminal control has been improved.
.Another important, albeit a bit embarrassing, point: Flexible rate mode should now work at all again.

:title It is here! Oh my mind! <strong>mpg123-1.0rc1</strong>
.<p>
.		The first release candidate of the heavily reworked mpg123 is ready! Grab it from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&package_id=148937&release_id=559279">Sourceforge</a> or from <a href="download.shtml">the download page</a>.
.		Please test, especially to help us improve the situation with the specific platforms we cannot test; see <a href="testing.shtml">the testing page</a> for that!
.</p>
.<p>A glimpse into the news:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>In one word: LOTS!</li>
.<li>Many small things that happened while migrating to the   
.  new setup.</li>
.<li>The decoder is now a library (libmpg123) which can be 
.  installed also for other programs to use.<br />
.  This finally provides a heavily improved replacement for 
.  the aged mpglib. We have doxygen API doc, example codes.
.  You can still choose to compile the decoder statically 
.  into the mpg123 binary, though.</li>
.<li>We have a plugin system for audio output! This should be 
.  relieving to package maintainers for binary 
.  distributions, drastically reducing the number of builds 
.  they have to provide.<br />
.  Here, too, you can choose to build one audio output into 
.  the binary like before; you can have your old-school one-
.  piece mpg123 or the hip I-am-legion shared-lib-and-
.  plugin flexible mpg123;-)<br />
.  One exception: For now, you have to compile without   
.  modules in MinGW32/MSYS/Cygwin.</li>
.<li>ID3v2 support has been enhanced and, in the case of 
.  specific comments (those with a description), fixed.
.  The ID3 parsing is part of libmpg123, offering support 
.  for virtually all textual information in ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3 
.  and ID3v2.4 tags (along with the usual 128 bytes of 
.  ID3v1 or ID3v1.1 in a block).<br />
.  All tag texts are converted to UTF-8, allowing mpg123 to 
.  properly display special chars in an Unicode terminal 
.  without fuzz (for non-UTF locales, there is still the 
.  ASCII reduction).</li>
.<li>Gapless decoding (of layer 3 streams) is now considered 
.  to be a standard feature and is enabled per default both 
.  at build- and runtime.</li>
.<li>...</li>

:title Traces of 1.0
.<p>As you know (if you cared;-), we are feverishly working on the big-o-1.0 release of mpg123 featuring output plugins and a new decoder library.
.Besides the <a href="/mpg123-svn-snapshot.tar.bz2">nightly snapshots</a> we now have a preview of the <a href="/api/">libmpg123 API documentation</a>, thanks to Nick introducing doxygen. We think it looks nice already:-)</p>

.</p>
.<p>
.Meanwhile, we are urging to get going in the 1.0 direction. We need <a href="testing.shtml">testing</a> and inevitable fixing of changed code on various platforms to make the next major release a pleasant one.<br />

.<p>
.mpg123 runs on a very large number of platforms and supports a wide 
.range of audio output APIs.
.However we the maintainers don't have access to all the systems that are 
.supported by mpg123. We are looking for official testers for various
.platforms to make sure that they still work before we make releases.

:title Me got something there: mpg123 version 0.67
.<p>
.Yes, it is time again; the list of changes has grown and a release was overdue.
.Also, the SVN branch that forms a new mpglib (libmpg123) and shapes the mpg123 application around it is lurking in the background, eager to take over the scene.<br />
.It is possible that 0.67 will be the last release of the old codebase, the next one being based on libmpg123.
.</p>
.<p>
.But that is future, what we have now in release 0.67 is this:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>verified that it builds on SGI IRIX 6.5 for MIPS32 and MIPS64</li>
.<li>enable flexible rate for stdout decoding, too</li>
.<li>UTF8 filtering to ASCII finally works thanks to Mika Tiainen, see bug 1745847</li>
.<li>corrected frame offset; -k was off by one</li>
	This means now that -k disagrees with mpg123 0.59r on many files because the old version does play a frame of silence when encountering LAME tag instead of dropping it for audio.
.<li>added --timeout <i>n</i>: Possibility to end playback on a stream that doesn't give data for <i>n</i> seconds.</li>
.<li>added --loop <i>n</i>: for ... well... looping playback of a track; motivation was persistent internet streaming with unreliable connection (together with --timeout)</li>
.<li>build fixes</li>
.<li>use movap instruction in SSE assembly when compiler supports the needed alignment (idea from MPlayer)</li>
.<li>show decoder options in their priority order in --list-cpu/--test-cpu</li>
.<li>added Perl script to benchmark each of mpg123's CPU optimisations</li>
.<li>portability enhancements and cleanups along with testing on SunOS 4.1.2 with gcc-2.7.0</li>
.<li>workaround for ugly flexible rate for MMX/SSE/3DNowExt code:
.  --with-cpu=mmx also includes i586 code as fallback; similar with the others</li>
.</ul>
.<p>So, head over to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704">sf.net</a> or our download page and get the new stuff!</p>
.<p>Thanks go out to Serge Simon and the R.O.M. 106.5 FM Team (<a href="http://www.rom.lu/">http://www.rom.lu/</a>) for their support, both in form of a monetary donation and a bottle of wine from Luxembourg:-)</p>

:title Bigg-o-release version 0.66!
.<p>
.Been some months, big stuff happened.
.This release finally adds the SSE and 3DNowExt optmized decoders as well as combined builds with runtime decoder selection.
.Also, the assembler codes now work on Cygwin and with MinGW32/Msys, the latter being added as supported environment including the resurrected Win32 audio output.
.</p>
.<p>
.Besides bug fixes and additions like named pipe / FIFO support for the generic control interface and more terminal control, the general portability with the new build system has been improved; also with less hardcoded decisions based on operating system type.
.</p>
.<p>
.A perhaps useful hack is also a new build (./configure --with-cpu=generic_float) that produces 32bit float samples on raw or WAV file writing.
.</p>
.<p>
.This is an important release, also it is hopefully the last release with monolithic audio output (plugin system is nearly there).
.The extracted libmpg123 will become reality in the not too distant future, too.
.Well, for now, go and get version 0.66 from the usual places (see <a href="download.shtml">download</a> page)!
.</p>

:title Opt, opt, opt! ... and some old gear.
.<p>
.In svn, there happened some new backport of MPlayer's mp3lib goodies: SSE and extended 3DNow! Now we are on par with the other fastest mp3 player also on current CPUs;-)
.Connected to the backporting is the first attempt to create an universal x86 binary that contains all the optimizations and enables choice at runtime; "all the optimizations" meaning all x86 floating point targets except i486, that doesn't fit the common scheme (yet).
</p>
.<p>
.Working on the performance front, I finally managed to build up a test box with a 486DX4-100 and put a Slackware 9 install on it. After verifying that mpg321 doesn't get you anywhere there, I built a i486 optimized mpg123 and took it out for a spin to pump some music into the headphones through the legendary AWE32 BigBoard.
.<br />
.It's just fine for 128kbit/s layer 3 stereo, user cpu load being around 66%, and the buffer catches hickups that occur with some high quality vbr (around 200kbit/s), load being more up to 70%.
.Mono playback (which doesn't use special i486 opts) is able to push the load down to around 50%, so indeed a 486DX2-66 or DX50 could be able to achieve something.
.<br />
.Seeing the still not fully used CPU, I also tried how <a href="http://dermixd.de">DerMixD</a> performs with two mpg123 input channels - one being played actively and the other buffered in background for possible crossfading later. It's nearly ok, but stuttering especially while buffering the second track. I suspect that it's not the cpu here but the i/o with the hard disk behind the CMD640 and/or the threading/context switching pushing system load. I'm gonna try how it is with a 2.6 kernel (NPTL) and also what newer compilers say - this slack has gcc-3.2 and gcc-4.1 improved considerably on performance!
.</p>
.<p>
.Oh, and also I extended the terminal control to include volume and RVA control / display as well added verbosity switch key for enabling/disabling messages / progress indication at runtime. You see: We need to tag a version on that and get it out!

:title mpg123 version 0.65 - go, get some bugfixes to play more files!

:title Merry Christmas! -- And here is my present for you: mpg123-0.62
.<p>
.It was time for the next release. It includes some nice enhancements and fixes:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>JUMP command in generic frontend accepts offsets/positions in seconds (JUMP 4s vs. JUMP 4)</li>
.<li>initial support for ICY meta data in SHOUTcast streams</li>
.<li>a bit of fixing with rva code, added rva and general volume control to generic frontend</li>
.<li>accepting more MIME types for http streaming (application/pls and audio/x-mpeg)</li>
.<li>ID3v2 info output taking less space per default - more resembling the old ID3v1 view for short tags, full view with always one line per item via extra --long-tag switch</li>
.<li>generally less verbosity (i.e. noise on console) per default</li>
.<li>ID3v2 now having some kind of support for unicode; trying to print what's latin1-compatible and prevent messing up of terminal with unknown bytes.</li>
.<li>several bug fixes and small improvements</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.You don't find this release on sourceforge yet as I am plainly unable to find the magic door to the new file release system. If anyone knows how to get a new file release out on sf.net, please let me know! I must have grown stupid and blind over night... (of course I blame the changed sf.net interface instead;-)

:title one month off
.<p>Well, the 0.60 version is just a month out there, about 10000 downloads were made (sf.net and here... there could be more weight on sf.net though), the homepage design got some resfreshment from Stefan Graubner (thanks for that first real mpg123 logo!) and </p>
.<div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">mpg123 is among Debian's <em>free</em> software now!</div>
.<p>
.The development didn't stop in the past months and there were bugfixes and enhancements all around.
.Nearly all audio outputs got changes in error handling (allowing restoration of terminal instead of just crashing out on error), thus I hereby kindly ask any interested folks to test if the fresh <a href="http://mpg123.de/download/mpg123-svn-r491.tar.gz">mpg123 svn snapshot</a> breaks anything - we cannot test every audio output since we don't have every platform available...

:title Finally the final release - get mpg123 version 0.60!
.<p>
.It is the night of the 29th August 2006 and the time the new stable mpg123 is slipping through my fingers into the net.<br />
.For those who didn't follow the development, here's the news:
.</p>
.<ul style="margin-left:1cm">
.<li>LGPL license</li>
.<li>compilation via ./configure && make (i.e. GNU autoconf...)</li>
.<li>many bugfixes</li>
.<li>more audio outputs, updated Alsa</li>
.<li>more robust playback</li>
.<li>MMX and AltiVec optimizations</li>
.<li>RVA/ReplayGain</li>
.<li>basic ID3v2</li>
.<li>improved http and playlist operation</li>
.<li>...just see yourself!</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.This version is the result of merging 0.59r by Michael Hipp and parts of his development tree with the 0.59r-gpl from sourceforge and mpg123-thor (both including patchsets from Debian) as well as continued work on the source of both Nicholas and myself as well as enthusiastic testers who gave us a purpose (thanks for being with us after that long time!).
.</p>
.<p>
.Long story short: Head over to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&amp;package_id=148937&amp;release_id=443356">sourceforge</a> and get it!
.</p>
.<p>
.Note for old school fellas: This official end user release only works with the new autoconf make system. The MakeLegacy.sh script for using the old-style Makefile needs a src/config.h.legacy file mimicking settings from the autoconf&acute;ed config.h . You can find an example that works on my linux laptop in the svn tree.

.<br />
.Also, the playlist code is now much cleaner and self-contained in an extra unit (well, what does the user care, eh? ;-).
.<br />
.Hurry up, buggers - we do not really plan to release another beta!

:title 0.60-beta4 is finally there!
.It was about time, we spent so much time coding on this that I now don&acute;t have the time for big words;-)<br />
.Important news include:
.<ul>
.<li>proper seeking, also for VBR streams</li>
.<li>real two-way seeking in remote control mode at all</li>
.<li>better estimates of remaining frames (on vbr files), exact if Xing header is found</li>
.<li>Removed libao support (as it is GPL and we aren't - and we don't need it with native Alsa)</li>
.<li>Added ALSA 0.9/1.0 support by Clemens Ladisch (old alsa is in audio_alsa05.c but will most likely vanish soon)</li>
.<li>Added PortAudio audio-output support</li>
.<li>Added SDL audio-output support</li>
.<li>Fixed NAS audio-output support</li>
.<li>re-enabled MPEG 2.5, code just seems to work</li>
.<li>improved stream checking; being more willing in general (favor resync instead of bail out) but directly give up if free format stream is obvious</li>
.<li>Whee! Initial Relative Volume Adjustment (buzz) support with reading of ReplayGain values in lame/info tag, the RVA2 frames in ID3v2.4, ID3v2 TXXX tags from foobar2000 (please test, someone!) and custom ID3v2.3 comments entitled RVA / RVA_ALBUM / RVA_AUDIOPHILE / RVA_RADIO / RVA_MIX</li>
.<li>more persistence in trying to get http streams</li>
.</ul>
.So, head over to downloads and get it, test it, report on it!

:title The next beta still near...
.There is an issue with the new Alsa output to be sorted out. I hope to release the perhaps last beta after having a fix for that.
.If you feel the urge to be on the edge don&acute;t hesitate to check the current svn version and report any issues.

:title The next beta is near!
.We are coming more close to something to be called stable; the last important bugfix was loosening an earlier bugfix to fit some files (only those encoded with new lame??). If you have stuttery playback / unsteady speed with some files, try the upcoming beta or a svn snapshot.<br />
.There is a new alsa output by Clemens Ladisch removing the need for libao (which is not LGPL) and the addition of RVA (relative volume adjustment) or ReplayGain support via Lame/Info tag and ID3v2 info - in theory even the ID3 tags that foobar2000 creates.

:title automatic fire - 0.60-beta3 is out!
.Thanks for quickly taking my bold statement about the best mpg123 ever to the test and providing the reports for two bugs that have been fixed.
.<br />
.Also, some enhancements crept in - mainly with http and playlists (where Shoutcast/Winamp PLS can now be parsed directly by mpg123).
.Please head over to sourceforge and find the next bugs to kill on the way to a stable release.

:title 0.60-beta2 release!
.Yes! The time has come - the new mpg123 shows its advent with the first public beta release.
.Don't wonder why it is called beta2, just go to the <a href="/download.shtml">download section</a> and get it!
.<br />
.This release is the first official product resulting from the merge of the 0.59r-gpl and 0.59r-thor forks back into <em>the</em> mpg123.
.Though tagged beta, I consider it being the best, most secure mpg123 version available now and encourage everybody to test it.
.<br />
.For sure there are glitches in the new/modified build system and general small issues with platforms that the current developers cannot test.
.Please help them (us) ironing these out before the final version 0.60 .
.<br />
.See the documentation in the source package or on sourceforge.net (release notes, changelog) for details on what&acute;s really new.

:title A note about Lame
:by Thomas
.During hacking with the gapless mp3 support, I investigated the working of which with different sampling rates.
.I guess I found a Lame bug concering the resampling it can do on request (removing audio at the end).<br>
.The <a href="/lame-resampling.shtml">page about my Lame/resampling tests</a> documents this and as a plus offers some plots showing the gapless mode working nicely.

.Half a year did pass not without serious work going on in the hidden.
.The next release, 0.60, will be based on <a href="http://thomas.orgis.org/mpg123-thor">mpg123-thor</a>, thus sporting the Debian fixes together with enhanced control interface.
.Furthermore, there will be
.<ul>
.<li>a clear license statement, spoken out loud for all distros to hear</li>
.<li>incorporation of the pre-0.59s MMX assembler code</li>
.<li>proper ignoring of "unsynched" ID3V2 data (no choke on embedden raw bitmap anymore...), as does pre-0.59s</li>
.<li>experimental (iow: not perfect but working) gapless playback of mp3 files encoded with Lame</li>
.</ul>
.You can have a glimpse on current development via subversion: `svn co svn://orgis.org/mpg123/trunk mpg123-svn` (will create folder mpg123-svn with current snapshot, but you knew that already;-)

.Important information about the Gobble Exploit: It seems, that only the
.pre0.59s version is vulnerable. The hotfix is to increase the 
.MAX_INPUT_FRAMESIZE to a big value. Ie 4096. I will review the whole code this weekend.
.I will also try to supply an mp3 checker this weekend. So it is not necessary to remove all
.your mp3s. Just do not play them with a potentially vulnerable player and check them later.
.Thanx.

.Propably your waiting for the next release, but
.I did not manage to apply all patches from my TODO list yet and
.added a few new bugs that I must hunt down first. Nevertheless, a lot of bugs are fixed in the
.CVS version. Please test it and report remaining bugs you find.

.Just to let you know: I'm still alive and I hope to have some
.spare time in september to add some patches and test the current CVS version to make
.a new minor release.
