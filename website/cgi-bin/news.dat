:title Large File Fuss
.<p>
.I feel the need remind the world about the messy issue of large file support (sometimes called largefile support instead;-).
.There are certain systems (notably GNU/Linux and Solaris) that have chosen to make that a decision at build time with the type off_t sometimes being 32bit, sometimes 64bit.
.You can compile apps with or without large file support.
.</p>
.<p>
.That means that you can have libraries for 64bit file offsets on your system and libraries for 32bit offsets.
.You can have applications (trying to) using libraries with a different file offset setting.
.That means one thing: Trouble!
.To prevent weird runtime errors or even crashes, I added some precautions to libmpg123, notably at build time, you could see such a message:
.</p>
.<pre>
./usr/include/mpg123.h:37:2: error: #error "Mismatch in large file setup!
  Enable/disable large file support appropriately to use libmpg123."
.</pre>
.<p>
.Also, at runtime, a 64bit offset libmpg123 will fail with a program that is not aware of this -- yielding unresolved symbols due to renaming the affected functions with a suffix indicating 64bits.
.</p>
.<p>
.If you encounter this, please read up and think about that problem, and possibly complain to your OS distribution or the software project whose code is failing. Especially GNU/Linux distributions should be interested in making sure that they don't mix largefile builds with non-largefile code.
.</p>
.<p><strong>Update:</strong> See the <a href="/faq.shtml#lfs">FAQ</a>.</p>

:title New Chapter of the Neverending but Unnerving Tale of 1.6.0
.<p>Let's face it: This week is tight for me. Possibly too tight to make a release.</p>
.<p>Besides all that real life work stuff, there's demanding involvement in organizing and taking part in the fith Brandenburger Linux-Infotag in Potsdam, Germany (BLIT), on 1st November. Perhaps around (or shortly after...) that would be a good time to clean up the docs and push the beast out after all. May be a good idea to settle the ongoing streamlining of the Windows builds during the week, too.</p>
.<p>Oh, and, eh... did I mention the BLIT? If you happen to be not that far from the state of Brandenburg (you know, Berlin's at the center of it;-)... you might want to pay the BLIT a visit; see the <a href="http://blit.org">BLIT-Website</a> for details!</p>

.<p>Well, 1.6.0 is still not out. We are showing bad discipline and keep adding features. Sorry.</p>

.<p>...for final testers! Please check out the current <a href="snapshot">snapshot</a> and report any issues.
.I intend to release 1.6.0 around this weekend...</p>
.<p>A nice number of improvements accumulated:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>small things inside that I forgot to mention</li>
.<li>some new commands for remote control interface:
.  <ul>
.  <li>SCAN</li>
.  <li>SAMPLE</li>
.  <li>EQFILE</li>
.  <li>SHOWEQ</li>
.  </ul>
.</li>
.<li>added --keep-open command line flag (for remote control)</li>
.<li>fixed equalizer file parsing to really handle comment lines as example file suggests</li>
.<li>more elaborate detection of UTF-8 locale, also --utf8 switch to force it</li>
.<li>libmpg123 9.0.9:
.  <ul>
.  <li>added mpg123_geteq() and mpg123_tell_stream()</li>
.  <li>API cleanup (take const char* for mpg123_open())</li>
.  <li>calm down complainling (C++) compilers by completing the mpg123_channels enum</li>
.  <li>fixed several possible crashes when user provides NULLs where it isn't appropriate</li>
.  <li>workaround for frames that fail decoding (bad frame body, missing bit reservoir): fill up with silence</li>
.    That also fixes seeking issues related to bad frames since now the fixed relation between frame and sample offsets is restored.
.  <li>Finally realized what that the resampling code for integer math (generic_nofpu) was just incomplete!
.    Now it works, using the defined integer multiplication.</li>
.  <li>Detect UTF-8 in ICY conversion (instead of just assuming CP-1252, provided by Torsten Glaser).</li>
.  <li>Prevent ugly noise when the bit reservoir is not fully there (p.ex. ignorantly cut mp3 files).
.    Concerned frames are silenced, but reservoir for following frames is kept.
.    Thanks to Patrick Dehne for the investigation and patch!</li>
.  </ul>
.</li>
.<li>new project files to build/use libmpg123 with MSVC++ 2005 and 2008, provided by Patrick Dehne</li>
.<li>fixed a regression that made the pause/loop mode in terminal control slowly go backwards</li>
.</ul>

.<p>
.As promised, version 1.5.1 is now out, featuring the 4 announced bug fixes (see news archive and tracker).
.One may note that with this version we seem to have taken all technical steps to make the XMMS2 plugin official (though the code in mpg123 distribution is outdated, there is the fresh stuff from XMMS2 folks).

.</p>
.<ul>
.<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2053181&amp;group_id=135704&amp;atid=733194">2053181: SSE decoder is not thread safe</a></li>

:title I-Pee, I-Pee!
.<p>The world shatters as version 1.5.0 of mpg123 is being released - now supporting IPv6 officially (a fresh implementation, after that other patch floating around for years...)!</p>
.<p>But that is not the only change we got there... various features/fixes on different scales went into this one:</p>
.<ul>
.<li> libmpg123 6.0.6
.<ul>
.  <li>Floating point decoding back again, (build time choice for now; --with-cpu=generic_float).</li>
.  <li>More robust string handling; extended string API.</li>
.  <li>fixed an (so far) unnoticed ID3 bug that may have obscured comment fields</li>
.  <li>added mpg123_feed() as shortcut; using const input buffer now</li>
.  <li>resync is enabled again for ICY streams (the trouble in the past was due to a reader bug, not the streams)</li>
.  <li>decode ICY text data to UTF-8 (thanks, Thorsten)</li>
.  <li>preserve file flags for timeout mode</li>
.</li></ul>
.<li> More elaborate (helpful?) error message for output format problems.</li>
.<li> Reworked HTTP code... and added IPv6 support!</li>
.<li> Fix the --proxy parameter (has been accidentally ignored before).</li>
.<li> Added --ignore-mime to work with web streams with funny playlist MIME types like "audio/megurl".</li>
.<li> Know MIME audio/mpegurl.</li>
.<li> --timeout is now also used for the connection itself (not just reading).</li>
.<li> Now trying to resume ALSA device after suspend.</li>
.<li> subtle build changes (your CFLAGS rule now)</li>
.</ul>

:title Glory days!
.<p>There are two important announcements to bring to you, favoured public:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>mpg123 1.x is in debian lenny (testing)! That means the next stable debian version will have a current mpg123 with libmpg123 as shared lib. That is <em>good</em>:-)</li>
.<li>I finally came around and reworked the http code to be able to update the stuff to support IPv6 (like some patch already did quite some time ago).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.The latter especially means that I need people to test the heck out of the current <a href="/snapshot">development snapshot</a> to find all the nice little bugs I introduced. Seriously: I need you people test the code for IPv4 and IPv6. Please. Test. And. Report to the devel mailing list or just directly to the maintainer.

:title Get your fix with 1.4.3!
.<p>We had a couple of nice little bugs to fix for this one.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Fix mpg123_tell() and mpg123_seek() return values with respect to the samples in decoding buffer (bug 1947373).</li>
.<li>Fix (bogus) 3DNow detection on IDT C6 (bug 1947982).</li>
.<li>Fix mono playback of win32 output (bug 1955157).</li>
.<li>Fix ABI compatibility with compilers that don't align the stack like gcc does (fixing SSE crashes on win32).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>So users of IDT CPUs, serious users of libmpg123 and any users of Windows systems (there are fresh binaries available) really would like to upgrade to the new release.</p>

:by Thomas
:title A flexed mpg123-1.4.0
.<p>The new release is there, adding essentially one convenience feature and one serious bug fix, here's the list:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>Enable runtime check for available and working output modules.<br />
.  Now mpg123 tries all built modules (or a list specified in mpg123 -o moda,modb,modc) in turn to find a working output.
.  This minimizes the situation of having to specify a device when default output doesn't work for some reason.
.  See bug 1910500.</li>
.<li>libmpg123 2.2.2
.  <ul>
.  <li>Fixing an endless loop for ICY streams that suddenly end without error (just EOF).</li>
.  <li>Further fixes around EOF handling in (buffered/ICY) streams.</li>
.  </ul></li>
.<li>Enable user to interrupt mpg123 when stuck in a loop of failing to open a track (with --loop).</li>
.<li>This time with correct RPM spec (hopefully... sorry, Michael!).</li>
.</ul>
.<p>In less words: Get it!</p>

:title A little fix for old Alsa: 1.3.1
.<p>
.This bugfix release just revives that snd_pcm_sw_params_set_xfer_align(pcm, sw, 1) for alsa-lib < 1.0.16 .
.The ALSA changelog just mentions removal of that function and that noone really understood why it's really there... well, it at least seems to be necessary for alsa-lib 1.0.14 on some systems.

:title The enhanced mpg123 in version 1.3.0!
.<p>
.This is a major fix/enhancement release for http streaming, much more usable for that than earlier mpg123 1.x versions.
.But that is not all: We have important bugfixes for decoding and ID3v2 parsing plus a new option for smoother experience with buffered playback.
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 libtool-version 2.0.2
.	<ul>
.		<li>Fix nasty bug in ICY reader that failed to account for partial reads from slower network.</li>
.		<li>Now non-seekable streams can get peek-ahead for MPEG sync, too, triggered by the MPG123_SEEKBUFFER flag.</li>
.		<li>Do not try to resync on streams with ICY metadata, that won't work.<br />
.			Consequently, if there's unreliable network, use --loop -1 to make mpg123 reconnect to the server on errors.</li>
.		<li>Applying a few layer 3 decoder fixes from old mhipp CVS (hail to the creator;-)<br />
.			That includes the fix for bug 1895025.</li>
.		<li>Fix ID3v2 parser with very invalid claimed ID3v2 frame sizes (could have triggered DOS before).</li>
.		<li>Oh, and fixed a steady memory leak in ID3 handling. Should mention that;-)</li>
.	</ul>
.<li>Print ICY-NAME and ICY-URL again, as mpg123-0.6x did.</li>
.<li>Added --smooth option for not flusing buffer between tracks but at program end only.</li>
.<li>Included some contributed ports/bindings of libmpg123 under ports/ .</li>
.</ul>
.<p>You are already heading for the <a href="download.shtml">download</a> section, aren't you? ;-)</p>

:title Bugfix release mpg123-1.2.1 .
.<div>
.A little taste of routine... treating some issues with this release:
.<ul>
.<li>libmpg123 libtool-version 1.2.1 (coincidence!)
.	<ul>
.		<li>Earlier check for free format headers to prevent them from screwing up resync (free format still not supported).</li>
.		<li>Bug 1889051: more flexible resync, not insisting on the format of the first frame (which could have been bogus).</li>
.	</ul></li>
.	<li>Add an output write loop to handle SIGSTOP/CONT operation (bug 1890563).</li>
.	<li>Fixed a bug where playback status for some http streams was not shown.</li>

:title Updating again: mpg123-1.2.0!
.<p>And here is the next incremental update, fixing some bugs, mainly in the build system, and adding the resync limit parameter to libmpg123 and the mpg123 app. There is convenience for RPM Linux distro users: You can run rpmbuild -tb on the mpg123 release tarball and get a qick-and-dirty rpm for installation though the included spec file.</p>
.<p>An embarrassing omission has been fixed, too: The i486 decoder files now actually are included in the distribution!</p>
.<p>
.So, head over to Sourceforge and get the stuff.
.</p>
.<p>
.Also in the news... we have mpg123 on the PSP with <a href="http://pspupdates.qj.net/MODO-January-30-update-added-MP3-support-via-libmpg123/pg/49/aid/112710">MODO</a>!

.<li>More verbosity on lame/xing/info tags (on demand) instead of compile-time debugging switch.</li>
.<li>XMMS2 plugin cleanup (submitted to XMMS2 for inclusion)</li>
.<li>Improved ID3v2 robustness (let bad tags not affect playback of the important part).</li>
.<li>Terminal control:</li>
.<ul>
.<li>Key for going to previous track ([d], because it's left of [f] usually... no config file yet for that).</li>
.<li>Key for printing current playlist, [l].</li>
.<li>Now possible to switch on verbosity also for mpg123 -q -C</li>
.<li>Key for (re)printing ID3 tag info ([t]).</li>
.<li>Key for (re)printing MPEG frame header info ([m]).</li>
.</ul>
.<li>Soften the -q option: Now you are able to increase verbosity after -q again, like mpg123 -q -v (this fixes cplay's progress display).</li>

:title Happy new mpg123! Version 1.0.0 is out!
.<p>
.Some fixes went into the 1.0rc3 during the week, but the substance is unchanged.
.It is time to release the stable version 1.0.0!
.Get the tarball from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&package_id=148937&release_id=563661"> Sourceforge</a> or the local <a href="download.shtml">download page</a> and enjoy.
.</p>
.<p>
.This is, finally, the first "complete" stable release of the revived mpg123 project.
.The 0.6x series already added a GNU autotool'ed build system and runtime cpu optimization selection, together with numerous bug fixes .and an enhanced generic control interface.
.</p><p>
.Now a big step has been taken, adding a re-born decoder library to replace the old mpglib (libmpg123) and support for run-time audio .output selection, which was one usability advantage mpg321 had over mpg123.
.Nearly every part of the mpg123 source has seen some restructuring or cleanup.
.</p>
.<p>
.The development from 0.6x to 1.0.0 also saw several smaller feature additions - make sure you check mpg123 --longhelp for anything you do not know already;-).

.Quite a few fixes and improvements went into the second release candidate.
.ID3 handling is safer now and IDv2 support has been added to the remote control interface.
.The buffer and general output code got much attention, so that, among others, the buffer now works properly on MacOSX, write errors to .output are handled now and the interactive experience with the buffer and terminal control has been improved.

.<p>
.		The first release candidate of the heavily reworked mpg123 is ready! Grab it from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&package_id=148937&release_id=559279">Sourceforge</a> or from <a href="download.shtml">the download page</a>.

.</p>
.<p>A glimpse into the news:</p>
.<ul>
.<li>In one word: LOTS!</li>
.<li>Many small things that happened while migrating to the   
.  new setup.</li>
.<li>The decoder is now a library (libmpg123) which can be 
.  installed also for other programs to use.<br />
.  This finally provides a heavily improved replacement for 
.  the aged mpglib. We have doxygen API doc, example codes.
.  You can still choose to compile the decoder statically 
.  into the mpg123 binary, though.</li>
.<li>We have a plugin system for audio output! This should be 
.  relieving to package maintainers for binary 
.  distributions, drastically reducing the number of builds 
.  they have to provide.<br />
.  Here, too, you can choose to build one audio output into 
.  the binary like before; you can have your old-school one-
.  piece mpg123 or the hip I-am-legion shared-lib-and-
.  plugin flexible mpg123;-)<br />
.  One exception: For now, you have to compile without   
.  modules in MinGW32/MSYS/Cygwin.</li>
.<li>ID3v2 support has been enhanced and, in the case of 
.  specific comments (those with a description), fixed.
.  The ID3 parsing is part of libmpg123, offering support 
.  for virtually all textual information in ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3

:title Traces of 1.0
.<p>As you know (if you cared;-), we are feverishly working on the big-o-1.0 release of mpg123 featuring output plugins and a new decoder library.
.Besides the <a href="/mpg123-svn-snapshot.tar.bz2">nightly snapshots</a> we now have a preview of the <a href="/api/">libmpg123 API documentation</a>, thanks to Nick introducing doxygen. We think it looks nice already:-)</p>
.<p>
.Also, I came around producing preview builds of libmpg123 as Win32 DLL using MinGW, by popular demand. See the <a href="/download.shtml">download section</a> for that.

.<p>
.Bug <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1807964&group_id=135704&atid=733194">1807964</a> needed some squashing. It has been there far too long, hidden in the dark corners of not-quite-standard MPEG 2.5 playback.
.Be quick and get it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&package_id=148937&release_id=551837">sf.net project download section</a> and enjoy your sub-16Khz files;-)
.</p>
.<p>
.Meanwhile, we are urging to get going in the 1.0 direction. We need <a href="testing.shtml">testing</a> and inevitable fixing of changed code on various platforms to make the next major release a pleasant one.<br />
.Please check out the <a href="mpg123-svn-snapshot.tar.bz2">nightly svn snapshot</a> on your exotic hard- &amp; software and report back to us!

:title Looking for testers
.<p>
.mpg123 runs on a very large number of platforms and supports a wide 
.range of audio output APIs.
.However we the maintainers don't have access to all the systems that are 
.supported by mpg123. We are looking for official testers for various
.platforms to make sure that they still work before we make releases.
.</p>
.<p>
.Take a look at the <a href="testing.shtml">testing</a> page for details.

:title Me got something there: mpg123 version 0.67
.<p>
.Yes, it is time again; the list of changes has grown and a release was overdue.
.Also, the SVN branch that forms a new mpglib (libmpg123) and shapes the mpg123 application around it is lurking in the background, eager to take over the scene.<br />
.It is possible that 0.67 will be the last release of the old codebase, the next one being based on libmpg123.
.</p>
.<p>
.But that is future, what we have now in release 0.67 is this:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>verified that it builds on SGI IRIX 6.5 for MIPS32 and MIPS64</li>
.<li>enable flexible rate for stdout decoding, too</li>
.<li>UTF8 filtering to ASCII finally works thanks to Mika Tiainen, see bug 1745847</li>
.<li>corrected frame offset; -k was off by one</li>
	This means now that -k disagrees with mpg123 0.59r on many files because the old version does play a frame of silence when encountering LAME tag instead of dropping it for audio.
.<li>added --timeout <i>n</i>: Possibility to end playback on a stream that doesn't give data for <i>n</i> seconds.</li>
.<li>added --loop <i>n</i>: for ... well... looping playback of a track; motivation was persistent internet streaming with unreliable connection (together with --timeout)</li>
.<li>build fixes</li>
.<li>use movap instruction in SSE assembly when compiler supports the needed alignment (idea from MPlayer)</li>
.<li>show decoder options in their priority order in --list-cpu/--test-cpu</li>
.<li>added Perl script to benchmark each of mpg123's CPU optimisations</li>
.<li>portability enhancements and cleanups along with testing on SunOS 4.1.2 with gcc-2.7.0</li>
.<li>workaround for ugly flexible rate for MMX/SSE/3DNowExt code:
.  --with-cpu=mmx also includes i586 code as fallback; similar with the others</li>
.</ul>
.<p>So, head over to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704">sf.net</a> or our download page and get the new stuff!</p>
.<p>Thanks go out to Serge Simon and the R.O.M. 106.5 FM Team (<a href="http://www.rom.lu/">http://www.rom.lu/</a>) for their support, both in form of a monetary donation and a bottle of wine from Luxembourg:-)</p>

:title Bigg-o-release version 0.66!
.<p>
.Been some months, big stuff happened.
.This release finally adds the SSE and 3DNowExt optmized decoders as well as combined builds with runtime decoder selection.
.Also, the assembler codes now work on Cygwin and with MinGW32/Msys, the latter being added as supported environment including the resurrected Win32 audio output.
.</p>
.<p>
.Besides bug fixes and additions like named pipe / FIFO support for the generic control interface and more terminal control, the general portability with the new build system has been improved; also with less hardcoded decisions based on operating system type.
.</p>
.<p>
.A perhaps useful hack is also a new build (./configure --with-cpu=generic_float) that produces 32bit float samples on raw or WAV file writing.
.</p>
.<p>
.This is an important release, also it is hopefully the last release with monolithic audio output (plugin system is nearly there).
.The extracted libmpg123 will become reality in the not too distant future, too.
.Well, for now, go and get version 0.66 from the usual places (see <a href="download.shtml">download</a> page)!
.</p>

:title Opt, opt, opt! ... and some old gear.
.<p>
.In svn, there happened some new backport of MPlayer's mp3lib goodies: SSE and extended 3DNow! Now we are on par with the other fastest mp3 player also on current CPUs;-)
.Connected to the backporting is the first attempt to create an universal x86 binary that contains all the optimizations and enables choice at runtime; "all the optimizations" meaning all x86 floating point targets except i486, that doesn't fit the common scheme (yet).
</p>
.<p>
.Working on the performance front, I finally managed to build up a test box with a 486DX4-100 and put a Slackware 9 install on it. After verifying that mpg321 doesn't get you anywhere there, I built a i486 optimized mpg123 and took it out for a spin to pump some music into the headphones through the legendary AWE32 BigBoard.
.<br />
.It's just fine for 128kbit/s layer 3 stereo, user cpu load being around 66%, and the buffer catches hickups that occur with some high quality vbr (around 200kbit/s), load being more up to 70%.
.Mono playback (which doesn't use special i486 opts) is able to push the load down to around 50%, so indeed a 486DX2-66 or DX50 could be able to achieve something.
.<br />
.Seeing the still not fully used CPU, I also tried how <a href="http://dermixd.de">DerMixD</a> performs with two mpg123 input channels - one being played actively and the other buffered in background for possible crossfading later. It's nearly ok, but stuttering especially while buffering the second track. I suspect that it's not the cpu here but the i/o with the hard disk behind the CMD640 and/or the threading/context switching pushing system load. I'm gonna try how it is with a 2.6 kernel (NPTL) and also what newer compilers say - this slack has gcc-3.2 and gcc-4.1 improved considerably on performance!
.</p>
.<p>
.Oh, and also I extended the terminal control to include volume and RVA control / display as well added verbosity switch key for enabling/disabling messages / progress indication at runtime. You see: We need to tag a version on that and get it out!
.</p>

:title mpg123 version 0.65 - go, get some bugfixes to play more files!
.<p>
.This release parses id3v2.3 (more) correctly and allows CRC bits to vary which fixes some files by old LAMEs and some streams that are cat'ed together.
.Also, attempts to make the build more friendly to non-GCC environments were undertaken.
.</p>

:title a short live for 0.63 - here is a hot update version 0.64
.<p>
.I got the report on a denial of service (mpg123 stuck in endless loop) possibility with a web server closing the connection prematurely, wiped up a fix for that and that warrants a quick release in my opinion.
.</p>

:title build fix update mpg123-0.63 now available
.<p>
.The 0.63 of mpg123 is now uploaded to sf.net and soon to be found on freshmeat... it mainly ships the one-line build fix that several people reported to be needed for gcc-3.3 .

:title Merry Christmas! -- And here is my present for you: mpg123-0.62
.<p>
.It was time for the next release. It includes some nice enhancements and fixes:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>JUMP command in generic frontend accepts offsets/positions in seconds (JUMP 4s vs. JUMP 4)</li>
.<li>initial support for ICY meta data in SHOUTcast streams</li>
.<li>a bit of fixing with rva code, added rva and general volume control to generic frontend</li>
.<li>accepting more MIME types for http streaming (application/pls and audio/x-mpeg)</li>
.<li>ID3v2 info output taking less space per default - more resembling the old ID3v1 view for short tags, full view with always one line per item via extra --long-tag switch</li>
.<li>generally less verbosity (i.e. noise on console) per default</li>
.<li>ID3v2 now having some kind of support for unicode; trying to print what's latin1-compatible and prevent messing up of terminal with unknown bytes.</li>
.<li>several bug fixes and small improvements</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.You don't find this release on sourceforge yet as I am plainly unable to find the magic door to the new file release system. If anyone knows how to get a new file release out on sf.net, please let me know! I must have grown stupid and blind over night... (of course I blame the changed sf.net interface instead;-)
.<br />
.Well, now go on to the download section and get it!

:title Behold the freshness - mpg123 0.61 is here!
.<p>
.It's time: The next regular release after the first "new" mpg123.
.There are bug fixes along with some improvements in error
.handling and playback as well as enhanced AltiVec code and
.even bits for good old i486.
.<br />
.The build system got some issues ironed out, mpg123 should
.now also build out of the box on cygwin (though not with
.assembler opts).

:title one month off
.<p>Well, the 0.60 version is just a month out there, about 10000 downloads were made (sf.net and here... there could be more weight on sf.net though), the homepage design got some resfreshment from Stefan Graubner (thanks for that first real mpg123 logo!) and </p>
.<div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">mpg123 is among Debian's <em>free</em> software now!</div>
.<p>
.The development didn't stop in the past months and there were bugfixes and enhancements all around.
.Nearly all audio outputs got changes in error handling (allowing restoration of terminal instead of just crashing out on error), thus I hereby kindly ask any interested folks to test if the fresh <a href="http://mpg123.de/download/mpg123-svn-r491.tar.gz">mpg123 svn snapshot</a> breaks anything - we cannot test every audio output since we don't have every platform available...
.</p>

.The next release will come.

:title Finally the final release - get mpg123 version 0.60!
.<p>
.It is the night of the 29th August 2006 and the time the new stable mpg123 is slipping through my fingers into the net.<br />
.For those who didn't follow the development, here's the news:
.</p>
.<ul style="margin-left:1cm">
.<li>LGPL license</li>
.<li>compilation via ./configure && make (i.e. GNU autoconf...)</li>
.<li>many bugfixes</li>
.<li>more audio outputs, updated Alsa</li>
.<li>more robust playback</li>
.<li>MMX and AltiVec optimizations</li>
.<li>RVA/ReplayGain</li>
.<li>basic ID3v2</li>
.<li>improved http and playlist operation</li>
.<li>...just see yourself!</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.This version is the result of merging 0.59r by Michael Hipp and parts of his development tree with the 0.59r-gpl from sourceforge and mpg123-thor (both including patchsets from Debian) as well as continued work on the source of both Nicholas and myself as well as enthusiastic testers who gave us a purpose (thanks for being with us after that long time!).
.</p>
.<p>
.Long story short: Head over to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&amp;package_id=148937&amp;release_id=443356">sourceforge</a> and get it!
.</p>
.<p>
.Note for old school fellas: This official end user release only works with the new autoconf make system. The MakeLegacy.sh script for using the old-style Makefile needs a src/config.h.legacy file mimicking settings from the autoconf&acute;ed config.h . You can find an example that works on my linux laptop in the svn tree.

:title 0.60-beta5 - playlist update
.The freshest mpg123 now is the beta5 of the upcoming 0.60 release. It fixes a bug that prevented
.<pre>
.cat list.m3u | mpg123 -@ -
.</pre>
.from working and enhances the playlist code by making the line reading buffer dynamic.
.<br />
.Also, the playlist code is now much cleaner and self-contained in an extra unit (well, what does the user care, eh? ;-).
.<br />
.Hurry up, buggers - we do not really plan to release another beta! 

:date 2006-08-22
:by Thomas
:title 0.60-beta4 is finally there!
.It was about time, we spent so much time coding on this that I now don&acute;t have the time for big words;-)<br />
.Important news include:
.<ul>
.<li>proper seeking, also for VBR streams</li>
.<li>real two-way seeking in remote control mode at all</li>
.<li>better estimates of remaining frames (on vbr files), exact if Xing header is found</li>
.<li>Removed libao support (as it is GPL and we aren't - and we don't need it with native Alsa)</li>
.<li>Added ALSA 0.9/1.0 support by Clemens Ladisch (old alsa is in audio_alsa05.c but will most likely vanish soon)</li>
.<li>Added PortAudio audio-output support</li>
.<li>Added SDL audio-output support</li>
.<li>Fixed NAS audio-output support</li>
.<li>re-enabled MPEG 2.5, code just seems to work</li>
.<li>improved stream checking; being more willing in general (favor resync instead of bail out) but directly give up if free format stream is obvious</li>
.<li>Whee! Initial Relative Volume Adjustment (buzz) support with reading of ReplayGain values in lame/info tag, the RVA2 frames in ID3v2.4, ID3v2 TXXX tags from foobar2000 (please test, someone!) and custom ID3v2.3 comments entitled RVA / RVA_ALBUM / RVA_AUDIOPHILE / RVA_RADIO / RVA_MIX</li>
.<li>more persistence in trying to get http streams</li>
.</ul>
.So, head over to downloads and get it, test it, report on it!

:title The next beta still near...
.There is an issue with the new Alsa output to be sorted out. I hope to release the perhaps last beta after having a fix for that.

:date 2006-08-13
:by Thomas
:title The next beta is near!
.We are coming more close to something to be called stable; the last important bugfix was loosening an earlier bugfix to fit some files (only those encoded with new lame??). If you have stuttery playback / unsteady speed with some files, try the upcoming beta or a svn snapshot.<br />
.There is a new alsa output by Clemens Ladisch removing the need for libao (which is not LGPL) and the addition of RVA (relative volume adjustment) or ReplayGain support via Lame/Info tag and ID3v2 info - in theory even the ID3 tags that foobar2000 creates.

:title automatic fire - 0.60-beta3 is out!
.Thanks for quickly taking my bold statement about the best mpg123 ever to the test and providing the reports for two bugs that have been fixed.
.<br />
.Also, some enhancements crept in - mainly with http and playlists (where Shoutcast/Winamp PLS can now be parsed directly by mpg123).
.Please head over to sourceforge and find the next bugs to kill on the way to a stable release.
:date 2006-07-25
:by Thomas
:title 0.60-beta2 release!
.Yes! The time has come - the new mpg123 shows its advent with the first public beta release.
.Don't wonder why it is called beta2, just go to the <a href="/download.shtml">download section</a> and get it!
.<br />
.This release is the first official product resulting from the merge of the 0.59r-gpl and 0.59r-thor forks back into <em>the</em> mpg123.
.Though tagged beta, I consider it being the best, most secure mpg123 version available now and encourage everybody to test it.
.<br />
.For sure there are glitches in the new/modified build system and general small issues with platforms that the current developers cannot test.
.Please help them (us) ironing these out before the final version 0.60 .
.<br />
.See the documentation in the source package or on sourceforge.net (release notes, changelog) for details on what&acute;s really new.

.The next release, 0.60, will be based on <a href="http://thomas.orgis.org/mpg123-thor">mpg123-thor</a>, thus sporting the Debian fixes together with enhanced control interface.
.Furthermore, there will be
.<ul>
.<li>a clear license statement, spoken out loud for all distros to hear</li>
.<li>incorporation of the pre-0.59s MMX assembler code</li>
.<li>proper ignoring of "unsynched" ID3V2 data (no choke on embedden raw bitmap anymore...), as does pre-0.59s</li>
.<li>experimental (iow: not perfect but working) gapless playback of mp3 files encoded with Lame</li>
.</ul>
.You can have a glimpse on current development via subversion: `svn co svn://orgis.org/mpg123/trunk mpg123-svn` (will create folder mpg123-svn with current snapshot, but you knew that already;-)
