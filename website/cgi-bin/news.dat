:title Bigg-o-release version 0.66!
.<p>
.Been some months, big stuff happened.
.This release finally adds the SSE and 3DNowExt optmized decoders as well as combined builds with runtime decoder selection.
.Also, the assembler codes now work on Cygwin and with MinGW32/Msys, the latter being added as supported environment including the resurrected Win32 audio output.
.</p>
.<p>
.Besides bug fixes and additions like named pipe / FIFO support for the generic control interface and more terminal control, the general portability with the new build system has been improved; also with less hardcoded decisions based on operating system type.
.</p>
.<p>
.A perhaps useful hack is also a new build (./configure --with-cpu=generic_float) that produces 32bit float samples on raw or WAV file writing.
.</p>
.<p>
.This is an important release, also it is hopefully the last release with monolithic audio output (plugin system is nearly there).
.The extracted libmpg123 will become reality in the not too distant future, too.
.Well, for now, go and get version 0.66 from the usual places (see <a href="download.shtml">download</a> page)!

:title Opt, opt, opt! ... and some old gear.
.<p>
.In svn, there happened some new backport of MPlayer's mp3lib goodies: SSE and extended 3DNow! Now we are on par with the other fastest mp3 player also on current CPUs;-)
.Connected to the backporting is the first attempt to create an universal x86 binary that contains all the optimizations and enables choice at runtime; "all the optimizations" meaning all x86 floating point targets except i486, that doesn't fit the common scheme (yet).
</p>
.<p>
.Working on the performance front, I finally managed to build up a test box with a 486DX4-100 and put a Slackware 9 install on it. After verifying that mpg321 doesn't get you anywhere there, I built a i486 optimized mpg123 and took it out for a spin to pump some music into the headphones through the legendary AWE32 BigBoard.
.<br />
.It's just fine for 128kbit/s layer 3 stereo, user cpu load being around 66%, and the buffer catches hickups that occur with some high quality vbr (around 200kbit/s), load being more up to 70%.
.Mono playback (which doesn't use special i486 opts) is able to push the load down to around 50%, so indeed a 486DX2-66 or DX50 could be able to achieve something.
.<br />
.Seeing the still not fully used CPU, I also tried how <a href="http://dermixd.de">DerMixD</a> performs with two mpg123 input channels - one being played actively and the other buffered in background for possible crossfading later. It's nearly ok, but stuttering especially while buffering the second track. I suspect that it's not the cpu here but the i/o with the hard disk behind the CMD640 and/or the threading/context switching pushing system load. I'm gonna try how it is with a 2.6 kernel (NPTL) and also what newer compilers say - this slack has gcc-3.2 and gcc-4.1 improved considerably on performance!
.</p>
.<p>
.Oh, and also I extended the terminal control to include volume and RVA control / display as well added verbosity switch key for enabling/disabling messages / progress indication at runtime. You see: We need to tag a version on that and get it out!
.</p>

:title mpg123 version 0.65 - go, get some bugfixes to play more files!
.<p>
.This release parses id3v2.3 (more) correctly and allows CRC bits to vary which fixes some files by old LAMEs and some streams that are cat'ed together.
.Also, attempts to make the build more friendly to non-GCC environments were undertaken.
.</p>

:title a short live for 0.63 - here is a hot update version 0.64
.<p>
.I got the report on a denial of service (mpg123 stuck in endless loop) possibility with a web server closing the connection prematurely, wiped up a fix for that and that warrants a quick release in my opinion.
.</p>

:title build fix update mpg123-0.63 now available
.<p>
.The 0.63 of mpg123 is now uploaded to sf.net and soon to be found on freshmeat... it mainly ships the one-line build fix that several people reported to be needed for gcc-3.3 .

:title Merry Christmas! -- And here is my present for you: mpg123-0.62
.<p>
.It was time for the next release. It includes some nice enhancements and fixes:
.</p>
.<ul>
.<li>JUMP command in generic frontend accepts offsets/positions in seconds (JUMP 4s vs. JUMP 4)</li>
.<li>initial support for ICY meta data in SHOUTcast streams</li>
.<li>a bit of fixing with rva code, added rva and general volume control to generic frontend</li>
.<li>accepting more MIME types for http streaming (application/pls and audio/x-mpeg)</li>
.<li>ID3v2 info output taking less space per default - more resembling the old ID3v1 view for short tags, full view with always one line per item via extra --long-tag switch</li>
.<li>generally less verbosity (i.e. noise on console) per default</li>
.<li>ID3v2 now having some kind of support for unicode; trying to print what's latin1-compatible and prevent messing up of terminal with unknown bytes.</li>
.<li>several bug fixes and small improvements</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.You don't find this release on sourceforge yet as I am plainly unable to find the magic door to the new file release system. If anyone knows how to get a new file release out on sf.net, please let me know! I must have grown stupid and blind over night... (of course I blame the changed sf.net interface instead;-)
.<br />
.Well, now go on to the download section and get it!
.</p>

:title Behold the freshness - mpg123 0.61 is here!
.<p>
.It's time: The next regular release after the first "new" mpg123.
.There are bug fixes along with some improvements in error
.handling and playback as well as enhanced AltiVec code and
.even bits for good old i486.
.<br />
.The build system got some issues ironed out, mpg123 should
.now also build out of the box on cygwin (though not with
.assembler opts).
.</p>

.We switched to a new server! Nothing should change on the outside, though.

:title one month off
.<p>Well, the 0.60 version is just a month out there, about 10000 downloads were made (sf.net and here... there could be more weight on sf.net though), the homepage design got some resfreshment from Stefan Graubner (thanks for that first real mpg123 logo!) and </p>
.<div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">mpg123 is among Debian's <em>free</em> software now!</div>
.<p>
.The development didn't stop in the past months and there were bugfixes and enhancements all around.
.Nearly all audio outputs got changes in error handling (allowing restoration of terminal instead of just crashing out on error), thus I hereby kindly ask any interested folks to test if the fresh <a href="http://mpg123.de/download/mpg123-svn-r491.tar.gz">mpg123 svn snapshot</a> breaks anything - we cannot test every audio output since we don't have every platform available...
.</p>
.<p>
.The next release will come.
.</p>

:title Finally the final release - get mpg123 version 0.60!
.<p>
.It is the night of the 29th August 2006 and the time the new stable mpg123 is slipping through my fingers into the net.<br />
.For those who didn't follow the development, here's the news:
.</p>
.<ul style="margin-left:1cm">
.<li>LGPL license</li>
.<li>compilation via ./configure && make (i.e. GNU autoconf...)</li>
.<li>many bugfixes</li>
.<li>more audio outputs, updated Alsa</li>
.<li>more robust playback</li>
.<li>MMX and AltiVec optimizations</li>
.<li>RVA/ReplayGain</li>
.<li>basic ID3v2</li>
.<li>improved http and playlist operation</li>
.<li>...just see yourself!</li>
.</ul>
.<p>
.This version is the result of merging 0.59r by Michael Hipp and parts of his development tree with the 0.59r-gpl from sourceforge and mpg123-thor (both including patchsets from Debian) as well as continued work on the source of both Nicholas and myself as well as enthusiastic testers who gave us a purpose (thanks for being with us after that long time!).
.</p>
.<p>
.Long story short: Head over to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135704&amp;package_id=148937&amp;release_id=443356">sourceforge</a> and get it!
.</p>
.<p>
.Note for old school fellas: This official end user release only works with the new autoconf make system. The MakeLegacy.sh script for using the old-style Makefile needs a src/config.h.legacy file mimicking settings from the autoconf&acute;ed config.h . You can find an example that works on my linux laptop in the svn tree.

:title no more betas... please! 0.60-beta6 is out
.Someone on IRC asked about ID3v2 support and I couldn't hold me back. Here is the update that also uses ID3v2 for displayed text info.
.Don&acute;t you think that this beta business is getting ridiculus, too? ;-)

:date 2006-08-25
:by Thomas
:title 0.60-beta5 - playlist update
.The freshest mpg123 now is the beta5 of the upcoming 0.60 release. It fixes a bug that prevented
.<pre>
.cat list.m3u | mpg123 -@ -
.</pre>
.from working and enhances the playlist code by making the line reading buffer dynamic.
.<br />
.Also, the playlist code is now much cleaner and self-contained in an extra unit (well, what does the user care, eh? ;-).
.<br />
.Hurry up, buggers - we do not really plan to release another beta! 

:date 2006-08-22
:by Thomas
:title 0.60-beta4 is finally there!
.It was about time, we spent so much time coding on this that I now don&acute;t have the time for big words;-)<br />
.Important news include:
.<ul>
.<li>proper seeking, also for VBR streams</li>
.<li>real two-way seeking in remote control mode at all</li>
.<li>better estimates of remaining frames (on vbr files), exact if Xing header is found</li>
.<li>Removed libao support (as it is GPL and we aren't - and we don't need it with native Alsa)</li>
.<li>Added ALSA 0.9/1.0 support by Clemens Ladisch (old alsa is in audio_alsa05.c but will most likely vanish soon)</li>
.<li>Added PortAudio audio-output support</li>
.<li>Added SDL audio-output support</li>
.<li>Fixed NAS audio-output support</li>
.<li>re-enabled MPEG 2.5, code just seems to work</li>
.<li>improved stream checking; being more willing in general (favor resync instead of bail out) but directly give up if free format stream is obvious</li>
.<li>Whee! Initial Relative Volume Adjustment (buzz) support with reading of ReplayGain values in lame/info tag, the RVA2 frames in ID3v2.4, ID3v2 TXXX tags from foobar2000 (please test, someone!) and custom ID3v2.3 comments entitled RVA / RVA_ALBUM / RVA_AUDIOPHILE / RVA_RADIO / RVA_MIX</li>
.<li>more persistence in trying to get http streams</li>
.</ul>
.So, head over to downloads and get it, test it, report on it!

:date 2006-08-13

:title The next beta still near...
.There is an issue with the new Alsa output to be sorted out. I hope to release the perhaps last beta after having a fix for that.
.If you feel the urge to be on the edge don&acute;t hesitate to check the current svn version and report any issues.

:date 2006-08-13
:by Thomas
:title The next beta is near!
.We are coming more close to something to be called stable; the last important bugfix was loosening an earlier bugfix to fit some files (only those encoded with new lame??). If you have stuttery playback / unsteady speed with some files, try the upcoming beta or a svn snapshot.<br />
.There is a new alsa output by Clemens Ladisch removing the need for libao (which is not LGPL) and the addition of RVA (relative volume adjustment) or ReplayGain support via Lame/Info tag and ID3v2 info - in theory even the ID3 tags that foobar2000 creates.

:title automatic fire - 0.60-beta3 is out!
.Thanks for quickly taking my bold statement about the best mpg123 ever to the test and providing the reports for two bugs that have been fixed.
.<br />
.Also, some enhancements crept in - mainly with http and playlists (where Shoutcast/Winamp PLS can now be parsed directly by mpg123).
.Please head over to sourceforge and find the next bugs to kill on the way to a stable release.
:date 2006-07-25
:by Thomas
:title 0.60-beta2 release!
.Yes! The time has come - the new mpg123 shows its advent with the first public beta release.
.Don't wonder why it is called beta2, just go to the <a href="/download.shtml">download section</a> and get it!
.<br />
.This release is the first official product resulting from the merge of the 0.59r-gpl and 0.59r-thor forks back into <em>the</em> mpg123.
.Though tagged beta, I consider it being the best, most secure mpg123 version available now and encourage everybody to test it.
.<br />
.For sure there are glitches in the new/modified build system and general small issues with platforms that the current developers cannot test.
.Please help them (us) ironing these out before the final version 0.60 .
.<br />
.See the documentation in the source package or on sourceforge.net (release notes, changelog) for details on what&acute;s really new.

:title A note about Lame
:by Thomas
.During hacking with the gapless mp3 support, I investigated the working of which with different sampling rates.
.I guess I found a Lame bug concering the resampling it can do on request (removing audio at the end).<br>
.The <a href="/lame-resampling.shtml">page about my Lame/resampling tests</a> documents this and as a plus offers some plots showing the gapless mode working nicely.

.Half a year did pass not without serious work going on in the hidden.
.The next release, 0.60, will be based on <a href="http://thomas.orgis.org/mpg123-thor">mpg123-thor</a>, thus sporting the Debian fixes together with enhanced control interface.
.Furthermore, there will be
.<ul>
.<li>a clear license statement, spoken out loud for all distros to hear</li>
.<li>incorporation of the pre-0.59s MMX assembler code</li>
.<li>proper ignoring of "unsynched" ID3V2 data (no choke on embedden raw bitmap anymore...), as does pre-0.59s</li>
.<li>experimental (iow: not perfect but working) gapless playback of mp3 files encoded with Lame</li>
.</ul>
.You can have a glimpse on current development via subversion: `svn co svn://orgis.org/mpg123/trunk mpg123-svn` (will create folder mpg123-svn with current snapshot, but you knew that already;-)

.MAX_INPUT_FRAMESIZE to a big value. Ie 4096. I will review the whole code this weekend.
.I will also try to supply an mp3 checker this weekend. So it is not necessary to remove all
