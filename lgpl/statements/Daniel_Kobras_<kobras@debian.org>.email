First of all, I wasn't aware of these projects, and I'm happy to hear
that work on mpg123, including my own contribution, is continued. Now on
to annoying legalese...

I know that Michael has asked all major contributors in the past whether
they'd agree if he later wanted to relicense mpg123 under the GPL. I'm
not aware of any blanket statement regarding LGPL, so unless you're
prepared to hunt down each and every contributor yourselves, I don't see
how you could release a new mpg123 with an LGPL license.

Furthermore, I've bugged Michael for a written statement along the lines
of "in accordance with all major contributors, mpg123 version 0.59r and
up shall now be licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License, version 2 or later, as published by the Free Software
Foundation in ...". I've gotten such a statement when we were talking to
each other. But in written form, I only know about the short note on the
homepage basically saying "hey, it's GPL".

You have permission to incorporate any of my work on mpg123 and
distribute them under the terms of the GPL, version 2, or LGPL, version
2.1 as distributed by the FSF. The Debian patches include work from
several contributors, usually listed in the changelog, and I cannot
decide on licensing of their code. Though I don't think anyone will
oppose the license switch, you need to check with each of them
individually. Ignoring trivial and Debian-only contributions, those
should be

Steve Kemp <skx@debian.org>
Dan Olson <theoddone33@icculus.org>
KIMURA Takuhiro <kim@comtec.co.jp>
Syuuhei Kashiyama <squash@mb.kcom.ne.jp>
Rupert Levene <rupert.debian@hotpop.com>
Andreas Dilger <adilger@turbolinux.com>
Erik B. Andersen <andersee@debian.org>
Chris Butler <chrisb@debian.org>
Martin Sjogren <md9ms@mdstud.chalmers.se>
Chet Hosey <chosey@budapress.com>
Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.de>

Some of them also have contributed code to Michael directly, and might
also have given him blanket permission for a GPL switch.

> 2. Would the license clarification pull the project out of non-free?

Yes, and my life as mpg123 maintainer would be a lot more easy. But keep
in mind that mpg123 and its non-freeness was very popular, so I'd expect
a lot of people to scrutinize any chance to its license. Better be
prepared with good evidence that each auther agrees with the new
license.

Good luck,

Daniel.
