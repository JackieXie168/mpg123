The License of mpg123
=====================

This is the 15th of July in the year 2006, after half a year of preparation and the contributor email campaign running for over 3 months, I'm going to draw a conclusion about the licensing of mpg123 project.


The license conditions of mpg123 have been subject to dispute and rejection by parts of the free software world in the past...
We want to have it straight now.
Michael doesn't have much freetime to maintain the code and bother with requests by companies wanting to use mpglib.
So, he already decided to place mpglib under LGPL and mpg123 under GPL in the past.
Now, after I applied for taking over maintainership we decided on placing as much code of the whole project as possible under LGPL to ease future code migration and merging between mpg123 and mpglib.

That decision was followed by a lot of work to track down as many contributors to both Michael's development tree and my -thor one as possible to ask them for explicit LGPL support statements.
I wrote to every Name/eMail address I could track down (including internet search for new addresses), regardless of the question if there indeed is some code left by that person.
I asked them to utter any problem they may have with LGPL license as well as contacting me if there are _no_ issues.

Of course, without having to ask again, supporters of LGPL are the initial author and the two current maintainers:

	Michael Hipp
	Nicholas J. Humfrey
	Thomas Orgis

Also, new stuff was included with explicit LGPL permission from

	Adrian Bacon
	Romain Dolbeau

Now for the folks having made suggestions and contributions over the years...
In the first round starting in March 2006 I wrote the initial mail to anyone I could get. That resulted in some positive responses - mostly in the style

"I don't remember what I did, but LGPL is fine by me."

A good number of eMail addresses is just broken (years have passed...) and another good number of addresses are either totally unknown or not known to be good or bad since no response (not even bounce - thanks, spam!) came back in over 3 months.

Some statistics for the first run: 86 total , 15 positive, 37 broken email, 34 unknown

Positive:
	Andreas Neuhaus
	Chris Butler
	Colin Watson
	Daniel Kobras
	Daniel O'Connor
	Daniel Skarda
	Erik B. Andersen
	Helge Deller
	Juergen Schoew
	Martin Denn
	Munechika SUMIKAWA
	Oliver Fromme
	Petr Stehlik
	Robert Bihlmeyer
	Samuel Audet
	Shane Wegner
	Stefan Bieschewski
	Steven Schultz
	Tillmann Steinbrecher
	Tomas Oegren
	Tommi Virtanen

Then, an investigation of the code revealed a core of people having actually left traces in the code.

Creators (of a whole file, driver...): 16 total, 5 positive, 2 broken email, 9 unknown

Positive:
	Andreas Neuhaus
	Juergen Schoew
	Oliver Fromme
	Petr Stehlik
	Samuel Audet

Modders: 7 total, 1 positive, 2 broken mail, 4 unknown

Positive:
	Tomas Oegren


That shows two things:

	1. It's impossible to get a response from everyone having contributed in some way.
	2. Everyone who I reached supports the license change to LGPL


So, for the sake of getting a reasonable step forward, I'm going to close the case.
There are three categories of code:

1. written by Michael or some other contributor who explicitly supports LGPL

	Clear case: LGPL

2. contributed years ago without license notice

	The grounded assumption of can be made that the contributor accepted Michael's conditions, esp. the part about the software being available without cost.
	Furthermore they gave the code into Michael's hands or placed patches in the internet without any claims concerning commercial uses - wich were not covered by the old COPYING file.
	Based on the assumption of acceptance for the mpg123 COPYING file and the included rule of Michael's decision for any further use, this code is to be placed under LGPL by Michael's decision.

3. contributed with notice

	Some code includes a note about it being GPL. Well, one has to respect that.


That results in the bulk of mpg123 being LGPL and some parts GPL only.

I will now examine the files of the mpg123 svn trunk as of 15.07.2006 with their respective legal status:


Stuff added by current maintainers, thus being LGPL:

Non-Code files from Michael, maintainers or just trivial content (safely LGPL, then):

To be removed from distribution and thus not licensed in any special way:

precompiled/
tools/

The mpglib source is not part of the core mpg123 distribution anymore - it's written by Michael, it's LGPL, it shall become a real library with own distribution and be married to mpg123 again.
