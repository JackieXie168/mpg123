2006-11-26: pasky noticing missing mime types
	03:19 < pasky> http://www2.rozhlas.cz/stream/00470014.mp3 is the pls
	03:19 < pasky> http://media.rozhlas.cz/_audio/00468472.mp3 is the audio

	That is application/pls for the first one:
	[playlist]

	NumberOfEntries=1
	File1=http://media.rozhlas.cz/_audio/00470014.mp3

	A PLS playlist just like shoutcast, just with a more generic type.

	second one is audio/x-mpeg ... hm, how many types should one add?

	Got notice about this one, not gentoo-specific, since we also have the changes causing this (through debian, I guess).
	Fixed it by storing and using purl_size, also changed ULONG_MAX to SIZE_MAX there...
