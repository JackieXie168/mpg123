Fuzzing mpg123
--------------

Matthias Wenzel <maZZoo@gmx.de> sent me a heavily deranged File (Bluemchen - Du und Ich / technically distorted mix;-) he prepared some time ago for the purpose of making mpg123 crash.
He succeeded, facing this conglomeration of mpeg1.0 and mpeg2.5 frames together with various errors (as it seems) made 0.59r and -thor6 segfault.
I hacked a around in layer3.c a bit to get over this file gracefully - after fixing the mpeg2.5 verdict in common.c!
mpg123 now spots one error more and doesn't just exit() on invalid sideinfo anymore.
We may come back to this beast again...

The second round... this time the Stravinsky track (we should try to use free tracks for inclusion of test cases in svn).
Again a segfault in dct36, traced back to the xrpnt pointer being incremented too far in dequantize and thus overwriting the block_type with some number much greater than 3.
The xrpnt stuff - this whole function - is a hammer for newbies (everyone not having written it). I now only made a dirty hack to catch this special case - I didn't really dive to the ground there.
I'm sure that Matthias will find another segfault...
