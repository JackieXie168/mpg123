Matthias Wenzel <maZZoo@gmx.de> sent me a heavily deranged File (Bluemchen - Du und Ich / technically distorted mix;-) he prepared some time ago for the purpose of making mpg123 crash.
He succeeded, facing this conglomeration of mpeg1.0 and mpeg2.5 frames to gether with various errors (as it seems) made 0.59r and -thor6 segfault.
I hacked a around in layer3.c a bit to get over this file gracefully - after fixing the mpeg2.5 verdict in common.c!
mpg123 now spots one error more and doesn't just exit() on invalid sideinfo anymore.
We may come back to this beast again...
